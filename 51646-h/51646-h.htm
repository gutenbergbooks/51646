</div>

<p>The text of this book is a literal and integral translation
of the <cite>Kriegsbrauch im Landkriege</cite> issued and
re-issued by the German General Staff for the instruction
of German officers. It is the most authoritative
work of its kind in Germany and takes
precedence over all other publications whether military
or legal, alike over the works of Bernhardi the
soldier and of Holtzendorff the jurist. As will be
shown in detail in the critical introduction, The
Hague Conventions are treated by the authors as
little more than “scraps of paper”&mdash;the only
“laws” recognized by the German Staff are the military
usages laid down in the pages of the Manual,
and resting upon “a calculating egotism” and injudicious
“form of reprisals.”</p>

<p>I have treated the original text with religious respect,
seeking neither to extenuate nor to set down
aught in malice. The text is by no means elegant,
but, having regard to the profound significance of the
views therein expressed or suggested, I have thought
it my duty as a translator to sacrifice grace to fidelity.
Text, footnotes, and capital headlines are all literally
translated in their entirety. When I have added<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
footnotes of my own they are enclosed in square
brackets. The marginal notes have been added in
order to supply the reader with a continuous clue.
In the Critical Introduction which precedes the text
I have attempted to show the intellectual pedigree of
the book as the true child of the Prussian military
tradition, and to exhibit its degrees of affinity with
German morals and with German policy&mdash;with
“Politik” and “Kultur.” I have therefore attempted
a short study of German diplomacy, politics,
and academic teaching since 1870, with some side
glances at the writings of German soldiers and jurists.
All these, it must be remembered, are integrally related;
they all envisage the same problem. That
problem is War. In the German imagination the
Temple of Janus is never closed. Peace is but a
suspension of the state of war instead of war being
a rude interruption of a state of peace. The temperament
of the German is saturated with this belligerent
emotion and every one who is not with him
is against him. An unbroken chain links together
Clausewitz, Bismarck, Treitschke, von der Goltz,
Bernhardi, and the official exponents of German
policy to-day. The teaching of Clausewitz that war
is a continuation of policy has sunk deeply into the
German mind, with the result that their conception
of foreign policy is to provoke a constant apprehension
of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
The first part of the Introduction appears in print
for the first time. In the second and third parts I
have incorporated a short essay on Treitschke which
has appeared in the pages of the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>
(in October last), a criticism of German diplomacy
and politics which was originally contributed to the
<cite>Spectator</cite> in 1906 and a study of the German professors
which was published, under the title of “The
Academic Garrison,” in the <cite>Times</cite> Supplement of
Sept. 1st, 1914. I desire to thank the respective
Editors for their kindness in allowing me to reproduce
here what I had already written there.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GERMAN VIEW OF WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The ideal Prince, so Machiavelli has told us, need
not, and indeed should not, possess virtuous qualities,
but he should always contrive to appear to possess
them.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The somber Florentine has been studied
in Germany as he has been studied nowhere
else and a double portion of his spirit has descended
on the authors of this book. Herein the
perfect officer, like the perfect Prince, is taught that
it is more important to be thought humane than to
practise humanity; the former may probably be useful
but the latter is certainly inconvenient.</p>

<p>Hence the peculiar logic of this book which consists
for the most part in ostentatiously laying down
unimpeachable rules and then quietly destroying
them by debilitating exceptions. The civil population
of an invaded country&mdash;the young officer is reminded
on one page&mdash;is to be left undisturbed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
mind, body, and estate, their honor is to be inviolate,
their lives protected, and their property secure. To
compel them to assist the enemy is brutal, to make
them betray their own country is inhuman. Such is
the general proposition. Yet a little while and the
Manual descends to particulars. Can the officer compel
the peaceful inhabitants to give information about
the strength and disposition of his country’s forces?<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Yes, answers the German War Book, it is doubtless
regrettable but it is often necessary. Should they be
exposed to the fire of their own troops?<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Yes; it
may be indefensible, but its “main justification” is
that it is “successful.” Should the tribute of supplies
levied upon them be proportioned to their ability
to pay it?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> No; “this is all very well in theory
but it would rarely be observed in practise.” Should
the forced labor of the inhabitants be limited to
works which are not designed to injure their own
country?<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> No; this is an absurd distinction and
impossible. Should prisoners of war be put to death?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
It is always “ugly” but it is sometimes expedient.
May one hire an assassin, or corrupt a citizen, or incite
an incendiary? Certainly; it may not be
reputable (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">anständig</i>), and honor may fight shy
of it, but the law of war is less “touchy” (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">empfindlich</i>).
Should the women and children&mdash;the
old and the feeble&mdash;be allowed to depart before a
bombardment begins? On the contrary; their presence
is greatly to be desired (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">ein Vortheil</i>)&mdash;it
makes the bombardment all the more effective.
Should the civil population of a small and defenseless
country be entitled to claim the right, provided
they carry their arms openly and use them honorably,
to defend their native land from the invader?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
No; they act at their peril and must, however sudden
and wanton the invasion, elaborate an organization
or they will receive no quarter.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>We might multiply examples. But these are sufficient.
It will be obvious that the German Staff
are nothing if not casuists. In their brutality they
are the true descendants of Clausewitz, the father of
Prussian military tradition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Laws of war are self-imposed restrictions, almost
imperceptible and hardly worth mentioning, termed
‘usages of war.’ Now philanthropists may easily
imagine that there is a skilful method of disarming
and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed,
and that this is the proper tendency of the art
of war. However plausible this may appear, still it
is an error which must be extirpated, for in such
dangerous things as war the errors which proceed from
the spirit of benevolence are the worst.... To introduce
into the philosophy of war itself a principle
of moderation would be an absurdity.... War is
an act of violence which in its application knows no
bounds.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The only difference between Clausewitz and his
lineal successors is not that they are less brutal but
that they are more disingenuous. When he comes
to discuss that form of living on the country which
is dignified by the name of requisitions, he roundly
says they should be enforced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“by the fear of responsibility, punishment, and ill-treatment
which in such cases presses like a general
weight on the whole population.... This resource
has no limits except those of the exhaustion, impoverishment,
and devastation of the whole country.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Our War Book is more discreet but not more
merciful. Private property, it begins by saying,
should always be respected. To take a man’s property
when he is present is robbery; when he is absent
it is “downright burglary.” But if the “necessity
of war” makes it advisable, “every sequestration,
every appropriation, temporary or permanent, every
use, every injury and all destruction are permissible.”</p>

<p>It is, indeed, unfortunate that the War Book when
it inculcates “frightfulness” is never obscure, and
that when it advises forbearance it is always ambiguous.
The reader must bear in mind that the authors,
in common with their kind in Germany, always enforce
a distinction between <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kriegsmanier</i> and
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kriegsraison</i>,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> between theory and practise, between
the rule and the exception. That in extreme cases
such distinctions may be necessary is true; the melancholy
thing is that German writers make a system
and indeed a virtue of them. In this respect the
jurists are not appreciably superior to their soldiers.
Brutality is bad, but a pedantic brutality is worse in
proportion as it is more reflective. Holtzendorff’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Handbuch des Völkerrechts</cite>, than which there is no
more authoritative book in the legal literature of Germany,
after pages of sanctification of “the natural
right” to defend one’s fatherland against invasion by
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">levée en masse</i>, terminates the argument for a generous
recognition of the combatant status of the enemy
with the melancholy qualification, “unless <em>the Terrorism
so often necessary in war</em> does not demand
the contrary.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>To “terrorize” the civil population of the enemy
is, indeed, a first principle with German writers on
the Art of War. Let the reader ponder carefully on
the sinister sentence in the third paragraph of the
War Book and the illuminating footnote from
Moltke with which it is supported. The doctrine&mdash;which
is at the foundation of all such progress as
has been made by international law in regularizing
and humanizing the conduct of war&mdash;that the sole
object of it should be to disable the armed forces of
the enemy, finds no countenance here. No, say the
German staff, we must seek just as much (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">in gleicher
Weise</i>) to smash (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">zerstören</i>) the total “intellectual”
(<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">geistig</i>), and material resources of the enemy. It
is no exaggeration to interpret this as a counsel not
merely to destroy the body of a nation, but to ruin
its soul. The “Geist” of a people means in German
its very spirit and finer essence. It means a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
good deal more than intellect and but a little less
than religion. The “Geist” of a nation is “the
partnership in all science, the partnership in all art,
the partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection,”
which Burke defined as the true conception of
the State. Hence it may be no accident but policy
which has caused the Germans in Belgium to stable
their horses in churches, to destroy municipal palaces,
to defile the hearth, and bombard cathedrals. All
this is scientifically calculated “to smash the total
spiritual resources” of a people, to humiliate them,
to stupefy them, in a word to break their “spirit.”</p>

<p>Let the reader also study carefully a dark sentence
in that section of the War Book which deals with
“Cunning and Deceit.” There the German officer
is instructed that “there is nothing in international
law against” (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">steht völkerrechtlich nichts entgegen</i>)
the exploitation of the crimes of third persons, “such
as assassination, incendiarism, robbery and the like,”
to the disadvantage of the enemy. “There is nothing
in international law against it!” No, indeed.
There are many things upon which international law
is silent for the simple reason that it refuses to contemplate
their possibility. It assumes that it is dealing
not with brutes but with men. International law
is the etiquette of international society, and society,
as it has been gravely said, is conducted on the assumption
that murder will not be committed. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
do not carry revolvers in our pockets when we enter
our clubs, or finger them when we shake hands with
a stranger. Nor, to adopt a very homely illustration,
does any hostess think it necessary to put up a
notice in her drawing-room that guests are not allowed
to spit upon the floor. But what should we
think of a man who committed this disgusting offense,
and then pleaded that there was nothing to
show that the hostess had forbidden it? Human
society, like political society, advances in proportion
as it rests on voluntary morality rather than
positive law. In primitive society everything is
“taboo,” because the only thing that will restrain
the undisciplined passions of men is fear. Can it
be that this is why the traveler in Germany finds
everything “verboten,” and that things which in our
own country are left to the good sense and good
breeding of the citizen have to be officiously forbidden?
Can it be that this people which is always
making an ostentatious parade of its “culture” is
still red in tooth and claw? When a man boasts his
breeding we instinctively suspect it; indeed the boast
is itself ill-bred. If the reader thinks these reflections
uncharitable, let him ponder on the treatment
of Belgium.</p>

<p>It will be seen therefore that the writers of the
War Book have taken to heart the cynical maxim of
Machiavelli that “a Prince should understand how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
to use well both the man and the beast.” We shall
have occasion to observe later in this introduction
that the same maxim runs like Ariadne’s thread
through the labyrinth of German diplomacy.
Machiavelli’s dark counsel finds a responsive echo
in Bismarck’s cynical declaration that a diplomatic
pretext can always be found for a war when you
want one. When these things are borne in mind
the reader will be able to understand how it is that
the nation which has used the strongest language<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
about the eternal inviolability of the neutrality of
Belgium should be the first to violate it.</p>

<p>The reader may ask, What of the Hague Conventions?
They are international agreements, to which
Germany was a party, representing the fruition of
years of patient endeavor to ameliorate the horrors
of war. If they have any defect it is not that they
go too far but that they do not go far enough. But
of them and the humanitarian movement of which
they are the expression, the German Staff has but a
very poor opinion. They are for it the crest
of a wave of “Sentimentalism and flabby emotion.”
(<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Sentimentalität und weichlicher Gefühlsschwärmerei.</i>)
Such movements, our authors declare,
are “in fundamental contradiction with the nature
and object of war itself.” They are rarely mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
in this book and never respectfully. The
reader will look in vain for such an incorporation
of the Hague Regulations in this official text-book as
has been made by the English War Office in our own
<cite>Manual of Military Law</cite>. Nor is the reason far to
seek. The German Government has never viewed
with favor attempts to codify the laws and usages of
war. Amiable sentiments, prolegomenous resolutions,
protestations of “culture” and “humanity,”
she has welcomed with evangelical fervor. But the
moment attempts are made to subject these volatile
sentiments to pressure and liquefy them in the form
of an agreement, she has protested that to particularize
would be to “enfeeble humane and civilizing
thoughts.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Nothing is more illuminating as to
the respective attitudes of Germany and England to
such international agreements than the discussions
which took place at the Hague Conference of 1907
on the desirability of imposing in express terms restrictions
upon the laying of submarine mines in
order to protect innocent shipping in neutral waters.
The representatives of the two Powers agreed in admitting
that it did not follow that because the Convention
had not prohibited a certain act it thereby
sanctioned it. But whereas the English representatives
regarded this as a reason why the Convention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
could never be too explicit,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> the spokesman of Germany
urged it as a reason why it could never be too
ambiguous. In the view of the latter, not international
law but “conscience, good sense, and the sentiment
of duties imposed by the principles of humanity
will be the surest guides for the conduct of soldiers
and sailors and the most efficacious guarantees
against abuse.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Conscience, “the good German
Conscience,” as a German newspaper has recently
called it, is, as we have seen, an accommodating monitor,
and in that forum there are only too many special
pleaders. If the German conscience is to be the
sole judge of the lawfulness of German practises,
then it is a clear case of “the right arm strikes and
the left arm is called upon to decide the lawfulness of
the blow.” It is, indeed, difficult to see, if Baron
von Bieberstein’s view of international agreements
be the right one, why there should be any such agreements
at all. The only rule which results from such
an Economy of Truth would be: All things are lawful
but all are not expedient. And such, indeed, is
the conclusion of the German War Book.</p>

<p>The cynicism of this book is not more remarkable
than its affectation. There are pages in it of the
most admirable sentiment&mdash;witness those about the
turpitude of plundering and the inviolability of neutral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
territory. Taken by themselves, they form the
most scathing denunciation of the conduct of the
German army in Belgium that could well be conceived.
Let the reader weigh carefully the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Movable private property which in earlier times was
the incontestable booty of the victor is held by modern
opinion to be inviolable. The carrying away of gold,
watches, rings, trinkets, or other objects of value is
therefore to be regarded as robbery, and correspondingly
punishable.</p>

<p>No plundering but downright burglary is it for a man
to take away things out of an unoccupied house or at a
time when the occupant happens to be absent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Forced contributions (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kriegschatzungen</i>) are denounced
as “a form of plundering” rarely, if ever,
to be justified, as requisitions may be, by the plea of
necessity. The victor has no right, the Book adds,
to practise them in order to recoup himself for the
cost of the war, or to subsidize an operation against
the nation whose territory is in his occupation. To
extort them as a ransom from the violence of war is
equally unjustifiable: thus out of its own mouth is
the German staff condemned and its “buccaneering
levies” upon the forlorn inhabitants of Belgium held
up to reprobation.</p>

<p>Still more significant are the remarks on the right
and duty of neutrals. The inviolability of neutral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
territory and the sanctity of the Geneva Convention
are the only two principles of international law which
the German War Book admits to be laws of perfect
obligation. A neutral State, it declares, not only
may, but must forbid the passage of troops to the
subjects of both belligerents. If either attempts it,
the neutral State has the right to resist “with all the
means in its power.” However overwhelming the
necessity, no belligerent must succumb to the temptation
to trespass upon the neutral territory. If this
be true of a neutral State it is doubly true of a neutralized
State. No one has been so emphatic on this
point as the German jurists whose words the War
Book is so fond of praying in aid. The Treaty of
London guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium is
declared by them to be “a landmark of progress in
the formation of a European polity” and “up till
now no Power has dared to violate a guarantee of
this kind.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He who injures a right does injury to the cause of
right itself, and in these guarantees lies the express obligation
to prevent such things.... Nothing could make
the situation of Europe more insecure than an egotistical
repudiation by the great States of these duties of international
fellowship.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
The reader will, perhaps, hardly need to be cautioned
against the belligerent footnotes with which
the General Staff has illuminated the text. They
are, as he will observe, mainly directed towards illustrating
the peculiar depravity of the French in 1870.
They are certainly suspect, and all the more so, because
the notorious malpractices of the Germans in
that campaign are dismissed, where they are noticed
at all, with the airy remark that there were peculiar
circumstances, or that they were unauthorized, or
that the “necessity of war” afforded sufficient justification.
All this is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex parte</i>. So too, to a large
extent, is the parade of professors in the footnotes.
They are almost always German professors and, as
we shall see later, the German professor is, and
is compelled to be, a docile instrument of the
State.</p>

<p>The book has, of course, a permanent value apart
from the light it throws upon contemporary issues.
Some of the chapters, such as that on the right and
duties of neutrals, represent a carefully considered
theory, little tainted by the cynicism which disfigures
the rest of the book. It should be of great interest
and value to those of us who are engaged in studying
the problem of bringing economic pressure to bear
upon Germany, by enclosing her in the meshes of
conditional contraband. So, too, the chapter on the
treatment of Prisoners of War will have a special,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
and for some a poignant, interest just now. The
chapter on the treatment of occupied territory is, of
course, of profound significance in view of the present
state of Belgium.</p>

<h2 id="h_16">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subhead">GERMAN DIPLOMACY AND STATECRAFT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bismarck, wrote Hohenlohe, who ultimately succeeded
him as Imperial Chancellor, “handles everything
with a certain arrogance (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Uebermut</i>), and this
gives him a considerable advantage in dealing with
the timid minds of the older European diplomacy.”
This native arrogance became accentuated after the
triumphs of 1870 until, in Hohenlohe’s words, Bismarck
became “the terror” of all European diplomatists.
That word is the clue to German diplomacy.
The terrorism which the Germans practise
in war they indoctrinate in peace. It was a favorite
saying of Clausewitz, whose military writings enjoy
an almost apostolic authority in Germany, that War
and Peace are but a continuation of one another&mdash;“War
is nothing but a continuation of political intercourse
with a mixture of other means.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The
same lesson is written large on every page of von der
Goltz<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and Bernhardi.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> In other words, war projects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
its dark shadow over the whole of German
diplomacy. The dominant postures in “shining
armor” at critical moments in the peace of Europe,
and the menacing invocations of the “mailed fist”
are not, as is commonly supposed, a passionate
idiosyncrasy of the present Emperor. They are a
legacy of the Bismarckian tradition. To keep Europe
in a perpetual state of nervous apprehension by
somber hints of war was, as we shall see, the favorite
method by which Bismarck attained his diplomatic
ends. For the German Chancellerie rumors of wars
are of only less political efficacy than wars themselves.
After 1870, metaphors of war became part of the normal
vocabulary of the German Government in times
of peace. Not only so but, as will be seen in the two
succeeding chapters, a belligerent emotion suffused
the temperament of the whole German people, and
alike in the State Universities, and the stipendiary
Press, there was developed a cult of War for its own
sake. The very vocabulary of the Kaiser’s speeches
has been coined in the lecture-rooms of Berlin University.</p>

<p>Now War is at best but a negative conception and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
its adoption as the <em>Credo</em> of German thinkers since
1870 explains why their contributions to Political
Science have been so sterile. More than that, it accounts
for the decline in public morality. Politically,
Germany, as we shall see, has remained
absolutely stagnant. She is now no nearer self-government
than she was in 1870; she is much farther
removed from it than she was in 1848. The inevitable
result has been, that politics have for her come to
mean little more than intrigues in high places, the
deadly struggle of one contending faction at court
against another, with the peace of Europe as pawns
in the game. The German Empire, like the Prussian
kingdom, has little more than a paper constitution,
a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex imperfecta</i> as Gneist called it. The
Reichstag has little power and less prestige, and its
authority as a representative assembly has been so
enervated by the shock tactics practised by the Government
in forcing, or threatening to force, a series
of dissolutions to punish contumacious behavior, that
it is little better than a debating society. A vote of
censure on the Government has absolutely no effect.
Of the two powers, the Army and the Reichstag, the
Army is infinitely the stronger; there is no law such
as our Army Annual Act which subjects it to Parliamentary
control. Even the Bundesrath<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> (or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Federal Council), strong as it is, is hardly stronger
than the German General Staff, for the real force
which welds the German Empire together is not so
much this council of plenipotentiaries from the
States as the military hegemony of Prussia and the
military conventions between her and the Southern
States by which the latter placed their armies under
her supreme control. In this shirt of steel the body
politic is enclosed as in a vice.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Nothing illustrates the political lifelessness of Germany,
the arrogance of its rulers and the docility of
its people (for whom, as will be seen, the former
have frequently expressed the utmost contempt)
more than the tortuous course of German diplomacy
during the years 1870&ndash;1900. I shall attempt to
sketch very briefly the political history of those years,
particularly in the light of the policy of calculated
Terrorism by which the German Chancellerie sought
to impose its yoke upon Europe. Well did Lord
Odo Russell say that “Bismarck’s sayings inspired
respect” (he might, had he not been speaking as an
ambassador, have used, like Hohenlohe, a stronger
word) “and his silences apprehension.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> If it be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
true, as von der Goltz says it is, that national strategy
is the expression of national character and that the
German method is, to use his words, “a brutal offensive,”
nothing could bring out that amiable characteristic
more clearly than the study of Bismarck’s
diplomacy. The German is brutal in war just because
he is insolent in peace. Count Herbert “can
be very insolent,” wrote the servile Busch of Bismarck’s
son, “which in diplomacy is very useful.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Bismarck’s attitude towards treaty obligations is
one of the chief clues to the history of the years
1870&ndash;1900. International policy, he once wrote, is
“a fluid element which under certain conditions will
solidify, but on a change of atmosphere reverts to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
original condition.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The process of solidification
is represented by the making of treaties; that of
melting is a euphemism for the breaking of them.
To reinsure Germany’s future by taking out policies
in different countries in the form of secret treaties
of alliance while concealing the existence of other
and conflicting treaties seemed to him not only astute
but admirable. Thus having persuaded Austria-Hungary
to enter into a Triple Alliance with Germany
and Italy by holding out as the inducement
the promise of protection against Russia, Bismarck
by his own subsequent confession concluded a secret
treaty with Russia against Austria. To play off
each of these countries against the other by independent
professions of exclusive loyalty to both was
the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Leit-motif</i> of his diplomacy. Nor did he treat
the collective guarantees of European treaties with
any greater respect. Good faith was a negotiable
security. Hence his skilful exploitation of the Black
Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris (1856) when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
wished to secure the friendly neutrality of Russia
during the Franco-Prussian War. Russia, it will be
remembered, suddenly and to every one’s surprise,
denounced those clauses. The European Powers, on
the initiative of England, disputed Russia’s claim to
denounce <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">motu proprio</i> an international obligation
of so solemn a character, and Bismarck responded
to Lord Granville’s initiative in words of ostentatious
propriety:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That the Russian Circular of the 19th October
[denouncing the clauses in question] had <em>taken him
by surprise</em>. That while he had always held that the
Treaty of 1856 pressed with undue severity upon Russia,
he entirely disapproved of the manner adopted
and the time selected by the Russian Government to
force the revision of the Treaty.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly a generation later Bismarck confessed, and
prided himself on the confession, in his Reminiscences,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
that he had himself instigated Russia to denounce
the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty; that he
had not only instigated this repudiation but had
initiated it as affording “an opportunity of improving
our relations with Russia.” Russia succumbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
to the temptation, but, as Bismarck cheerfully admits,
not without reluctance.</p>

<p>This, however, is not all: Europe “saved her
face” by putting on record in the Conference of
London (1871) a Protocol, subscribed by the Plenipotentiaries
of all the Powers, in which it was laid
down as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“an essential principle of the law of nations that no
Power can repudiate treaty engagements or modify
treaty provisions, except with the consent of the contracting
parties by mutual agreement.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This instrument has been called, not inaptly, the
foundation of the public law of Europe. It was in
virtue of this principle that Russia was obliged to
submit the Russo-Turkish Treaty of San Stefano,
and with it the fruits of her victories in 1877&ndash;8 to the
arbitrament of the Congress of Berlin. At that Congress
Bismarck played his favorite rôle of “honest
broker,” and there is considerable ground for believing
that he sold the same stock several times over to
different clients and pocketed the “differences.”
What kind of conflicting assurances he gave to the
different Powers will never be fully known, but there
is good ground for believing that in securing the
temporary occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina he had
in mind the ultimate Germanization of the Adriatic,
and that domination of the Mediterranean at the expense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of England which has long been the dream of
German publicists from Treitschke onward.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> What,
however, clearly emerged from the Congress, and was
embodied in Article XXV of the Berlin Treaty, was,
that Austria was to occupy and administer Bosnia-Herzegovina
under a European mandate. She acquired
lordship without ownership; in other words,
the territory became a Protectorate. Her title, as it
originated in, so it was limited by, the Treaty of
Berlin. Exactly thirty years later, in the autumn
of 1908, Austria, acting in concert with Germany,
abused her fiduciary position and without any mandate
from the Powers annexed the territory of which
she had been made the guardian. This arbitrary action
was a violation of the principle to which she and
Germany had subscribed at the London Conference,
and Sir Edward Grey attempted, as Lord Granville
had done before him, to preserve the credit of the
public law of Europe by a conference which should
consider the compensation due to Servia for an act
which so gravely compromised her security. Russia,
France, and Italy joined with Great Britain in
this heroic, if belated, attempt to save the international
situation. It was at this moment (March;
1909) that Germany appeared on the scene “in
shining armor,” despatched a veiled ultimatum to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Russia, with a covert threat to mobilize, and forced
her to abandon her advocacy of the claims of Servia
and, with them, of the public law of Europe.</p>

<p>Thus did History repeat itself. Germany stood
forth once again as the chartered libertine of Europe
whom no faith could bind and no duty oblige. May
it not be said of her what Machiavelli said of Alexander
Borgia: “E non fu mai uomo che avesse maggiore
efficacia in asseveraie, e che con maggiori giuramenti
affermasse una cosa, e che l’osservasse meno.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It would carry me far beyond the limits of this
Introduction to trace in like detail the German policy
of <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Scharfmacherei</i> which consisted, to use the mordant
phrase of M. Hanotaux, in putting up to auction
that which is not yours to sell and, not infrequently,
knocking it down to more than one bidder. That
Bismarck encouraged Russian ambitions in Asia and
French ambitions in Africa with the view of making
mischief between each of them and England is notorious.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
In his earlier attitude he was content to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
play the rôle of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tertius gaudens</i>; in his later he was
an active <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agent provocateur</i>&mdash;particularly during the
years 1883&ndash;1885, when he joined in the scramble for
Africa. The earlier attitude is well indicated in
Hohenlohe’s revelations, that Bismarck regarded
French colonial operations as a timely diversion from
the Rhine, and would not be at all sorry “to see the
English and French locomotives come into collision,”
and a French annexation of Morocco would have had
his benevolent approval. After 1883 his attitude
was less passive but not less mischievous. Ten years
earlier he had told Lord Odo Russell that colonies
“would only be a cause of weakness” to Germany.
But by 1883 he had been slowly and reluctantly converted
to the militant policy of the Colonial party
and the cry of <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Weltpolitik</i> was as good as a war scare
for electioneering purposes. It was in these
days that hatred of England, a hatred conceived in
jealousy of her world-Empire, was brought forth,
and the obstetrics of Treitschke materially assisted
its birth. Bismarck, however, as readers of his
Reminiscences are well aware, had an intellectual
dislike of England based on her forms of government.
He loved the darker ways of diplomacy and
he thought our Cabinet system fatal to them. He
had an intense dislike of Parliamentarism, he despised
alliances “for which the Crown is not answerable
but only the fleeting cabinet of the day,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and above all he hated plain dealing and publicity.
“It is astonishing,” wrote Lord Ampthill, “how
cordially Bismarck hates our Blue Books.”</p>

<p>The story of Bismarck’s diplomatic relations with
England during these years exhibits the same features
of duplicity tempered by violence as marked
his relations with the rest of Europe. He acquired
Samoa by a deliberate breach of faith, and his pretense
of negotiations with this country to delimit the
frontiers of English and German acquisitions while
he stole a march upon us were properly stigmatized
by the Colonial Office as “shabby behavior.”
Whether he really egged on France to “take Tunis”
in order to embroil her with England will perhaps
never be really known,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> but it was widely suspected
in France that his motives in supporting, if not instigating,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
the colonial policy of Jules Ferry would
not bear a very close examination. That he regarded
it as a timely diversion from the Rhine is
certain; that he encouraged it as a promising embarrassment
to England is probable. There can be
no doubt that much the same construction is to be
put on his attitude towards Russia’s aspirations in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Asia; that they should divert Russia from Europe
was necessary; that they might entangle her with
England was desirable.</p>

<p>Fear of Russia has, in fact, always been an obsession
of the German Government. That fear is the
just Nemesis of Frederick the Great’s responsibility
for the infamous Partition of Poland. The reader,
who wants to understand the causes of this, cannot
do better than study an old map of the kingdom of
Poland, and compare it with a map of Poland after
the first and second Partitions. The effect of those
cynical transactions was to extinguish an ancient
“buffer state,” separating Prussia, Austria, and Russia,
and by extinguishing it to bring them into
menacing contiguity with each other. Never has
any crime so haunted its perpetrators. Poland has
been the permanent distraction of the three nations
who dismembered her, each perpetually suspicious
of the other two, and this fact is the main clue to the
history of Eastern Europe.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The fear of Russia, and
of a Russo-French or a Russo-Austrian Alliance, is
the dominant feature of Bismarck’s diplomacy. He
was, indeed, the evil genius of Russia for, by his
own confession,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> he intrigued to prevent her from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
pursuing a liberal policy towards Poland, for fear
that she would thereby be drawn into friendship
with France. To induce her to break faith with
Russia, her Polish subjects in one case, and with
Europe in another&mdash;the former by suppressing the
Polish constitutional movement; the latter by repudiating
the Black Sea clauses&mdash;was to isolate her
from Europe. German writers to-day affect to speak
of “Muscovite barbarism” and “Oriental despotism,”
but it has been the deliberate policy of
Germany to cut Russia off from the main stream of
European civilization&mdash;to turn her face Eastwards,
thereby Bismarck hoped, to quote his own words, to
“weaken her pressure on our Eastern frontiers.”</p>

<p>But Bismarck’s contempt for treaties and his love
for setting other Powers by the ears were venial compared
with his policy of Terrorism. His attitude to
France from 1870 to the day of his retirement from
office&mdash;and it has been mis-stated many times by his
successors&mdash;was very much that which Newman
ascribed to the Erastian view of the treatment of the
church&mdash;“to keep her low” and in a perpetual state
of terror-stricken servility. That this is no exaggeration
will be apparent from what follows here about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the war scares with which he terrified France, and
with France Europe also, in the years 1873&ndash;5, the
years, when, as our ambassador at Paris, Lord Lytton,
has put it, he “played with her like a cat with a
mouse.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Perhaps the most illuminating account of
these tenebrous proceedings is to be derived from
Hohenlohe, who accepted the offer of the German
Embassy at Paris in May, 1874. The post was no
easy one. There had already been a “scare” in the
previous December, when Bismarck menaced the
Duc de Broglie with war, using the attitude of the
French Bishops as a pretext;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and, although Hohenlohe’s
appointment was at first regarded as an eirenicon,
there followed a period of extreme tension, when,
as the Duc Decazes subsequently confessed, French
Ministers were “living at the mercy of the smallest
incident, the least mistake.”</p>

<p>The truth about the subsequent war scare of 1875
is still a matter of speculation, but the documents
published of late years by de Broglie and Hanotaux,
and the despatches of Lord Odo Russell, have thrown
considerable suspicion of a very positive kind on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Bismarck’s plea that it was all a malicious invention
of Gontaut-Biron, the French Ambassador, and of
Gortchakoff. A careful collation of the passages in
Hohenlohe’s Memoirs goes far to confirm these suspicions,
and, incidentally, to reveal Bismarck’s inner
diplomacy in a very sinister light. Hohenlohe was
appointed to succeed the unhappy Arnim, who had
made himself obnoxious to Bismarck by his independence,
and he was instructed by the Chancellor,
that it was to the interest of Germany to see that
France should become “a weak Republic and anarchical,”
so as to be a negligible quantity in European
politics, on which the Emperor William I remarked
to Hohenlohe that “that was not a policy,”
and was not “decent,” subsequently confiding to
Hohenlohe that Bismarck was trying “to drive him
more and more into war”; whereupon Hohenlohe
confidently remarked: “I know nothing of it, and
I should be the first to hear of it.” Hohenlohe soon
found reason to change his opinion. As Gortchakoff
remarked to Decazes, “they have a difficult way with
diplomatists at Berlin,” and Hohenlohe was instructed
to press the French Ministry for the recall of
Gontaut-Biron, against whom Bismarck complained
on account of his Legitimist opinions and his friendship
with the Empress Augusta. Thereupon, that
supple and elusive diplomat, the Duc Decazes, parried
by inviting an explanation of the menacing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
words which Gontaut-Biron declared had been uttered
to him by Radowitz, a Councilor of Legation
in Berlin, to the effect that “it would be both politic
and Christian to declare war at once,” the Duke
adding shrewdly: “One doesn’t invent these
things.” Hohenlohe in his perplexity tried to get
at the truth from Bismarck, and met with what
seems to us a most disingenuous explanation. Bismarck
said Radowitz denied the whole thing, but
added that, even if he had said it, Gontaut-Biron had
no right to report it. He admitted, however, that
Radowitz made mischief and “egged on” Bülow, the
Foreign Secretary. “You may be sure,” he added,
“that these two between them would land us in a
war in four weeks if I didn’t act as safety-valve.”
Hohenlohe took advantage of this confession to press
for the despatch of Radowitz to some distant Embassy
“to cool himself.” To this Bismarck assented,
but a few days later declared that Radowitz was indispensable.
When Hohenlohe attempted to sound
Bismarck on the subject the Chancellor showed the
utmost reserve. After the war scare had passed,
Decazes related to Hohenlohe an earlier example of
Imperial truculence on the part of Arnim, who, on
leaving after a call, turned round as he reached the
door and called out: “I have forgotten one thing.
Recollect that I forbid you to get possession of
Tunis”; and when Decazes affected to regard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
matter as a jest, Arnim repeated with emphasis:
“Yes, I forbid it.” Hohenlohe adds that an examination
of his predecessor’s papers convinced him that
Arnim did not speak without express authorization.
When the elections for the French Chamber are
imminent in the autumn of 1877, Bismarck informs
Hohenlohe that Germany will adopt “a threatening
attitude,” but “the scene will be laid in Berlin, not
in Paris.” The usual Press campaign followed,
much to the vexation of the Emperor, who complained
to Hohenlohe that the result of these “pin-pricks”
(Nadelstiche) would provoke the French people beyond
endurance.</p>

<p>In studying this calculated truculence we have to
remember that in Germany foreign and domestic
policy are inextricably interwoven. A war scare is
with the German Government a favorite method of
bringing the Reichstag to a docile frame of mind
and diverting it from inconvenient criticism of the
Government’s policy at home. Moreover, just as
war is, in von der Goltz’s words, a reflection of national
character, so is diplomacy. A nation’s character
is revealed in its diplomacy just as a man’s
breeding is revealed in his conversation.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> We must
therefore take into account the polity of Germany
and its political standards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
The picture of the Prussian autocracy in the later
days of Bismarck’s rule which we can reconstruct
from different entries in Hohenlohe’s Journal from
the year 1885 onwards is a very somber one. It is
a picture of suspicion, treachery, vacillation, and
calumny in high places which remind one of nothing
so much as the Court of the later Bourbons. It is
a régime of violence abroad and dissensions at home.
Bismarck’s health was failing him, and with his
health his temper. He complained to Hohenlohe
that his head “grew hot” the moment he worked,
and the latter hardly dared to dispute with him on
the gravest matters of State. Readers of Busch will
remember his frank disclosures of the anarchy of
the Foreign Office when Bismarck was away: “if
the Chief gives violent instructions, they are carried
out with still greater violence.” In Hohenlohe we
begin to see all the grave implications of this. Bismarck,
with what Lord Odo Russell called his passion
for authority, was fond of sneering at English
foreign policy as liable to be blown about with every
wind of political doctrine; but if Parliamentary control
has its defects, autocracy has defects more insidious
still. Will becomes caprice, and foreign relations
are at the mercy of bureaucrats who have no
sense of responsibility so long as they can adroitly
flatter their master. When a bureaucrat trained
under this system arrives at power, the result may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
be nothing less than disastrous. This was what happened
when Bismarck’s instrument, Holstein, concentrated
power into his own hands at the Foreign
Office; and as the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Neue Freie Presse</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> pointed out
in its disclosures on his fall (1906), the results are
writ large in the narrowly averted catastrophe of a
war with France in 1905. Bismarck’s disciples had
all his calculated violence without its timeliness. In
the Foreign Office, Hohenlohe discovered a kind of
anarchical “republicanism”&mdash;“nobody,” in Bismarck’s
frequent absence “will own responsibility
to any one else.” “Bismarck is nervously excitable,”
writes Hohenlohe in March, 1885, “and harasses
his subordinates and frightens them, so that
they see more behind his expression than there really
is.” Like most small men, in terror themselves, they
terrorized others. Moreover, the disinclination of
the Prussian mind, which Bismarck himself once
noted, to accept any responsibility which is not covered
by instructions, tended to reduce the German
Ambassadors abroad to the level of mere aides-de-camp.
Hohenlohe found himself involved in the
same embarrassments at Paris as Count Münster did
in London. Any one who has studied the inner history
of German foreign policy must have divined a
secret diplomacy as devious of its kind as that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Louis XV. Of its exact bearings little is known, but
a great deal may reasonably be suspected. There is
always the triple diplomacy of the Court, the Imperial
Chancery, and lastly the Diplomatic Service,
which is not necessarily in the confidence of either.</p>

<p>The same debilitating influences of a dictatorship
were at work in Ministerial and Parliamentary life.
Bismarck had an equal contempt for the collective
responsibility of Ministers and for Parliamentary
control. Having done his best to deprive the Members
of the Reichstag of power, he was annoyed at
their irresponsibility. He called men like Bennigsen
and Windhorst silly schoolboy politicians (Karlchen-Miesnick-Tertianen)
or “lying scoundrels”
(verlogene Halunken). He was surprised that representation
without control resulted in faction. It
is the Nemesis of his own political doctrines. When
he met with opposition he clamored for repressive
measures, and could not understand some of the
scruples of the Liberals as to the exceptional laws
against the Socialists. Moreover, having tried, like
another Richelieu, to reduce his fellow-Ministers to
the position of clerks, he was annoyed at their want
of corporate spirit, and when they refused to follow
him into his retirement, he declaimed against their
apostasy in having “left him in the lurch.” He
talked at one time of abolishing the Reichstag; at
another of having a special post created for himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
as “General-Adjutant.” He complained of overwork&mdash;and
his energy was Titanic&mdash;but he insisted
on keeping his eye on everything, conscientiously
enough, because, he tells Hohenlohe, “he
could not put his name to things which did not reflect
his own mind.” But perhaps the gravest moral of it
all is the Nemesis of deception. It is difficult to be
both loved and feared, said Machiavelli. There is
a somber irony in the remark of the Czar to the Emperor
in 1892, which the latter repeated to Hohenlohe.
Bismarck had been compelled to retire because
he had failed to induce the Emperor to violate
Germany’s contractual obligations to Austria by renewing
his secret agreement with Russia, and he consoled
himself in his retirement with the somewhat
unctuous reflection that he was a martyr to the cause
of Russo-German friendship, betrayed, according to
him, by Caprivi. “Do you know,” said the young
Emperor (in August, 1892), “the Czar has told me
he has every trust in Caprivi; whereas when Bismarck
has said anything to him he has always had
the conviction that ‘he is tricking me.’” We are
reminded of the occasion when Talleyrand told the
truth so frankly that his interlocutor persisted in
regarding it as an elaborate form of deception.
After all, there are advantages, even in diplomacy,
in being what Schuvaloff called Caprivi, a “too honest
man.” It was the same with the domestic atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Bismarck, an adept at deceiving, is always
complaining of deception; a master of intrigue, he
is always declaiming against the intrigues of others.
He inveighs against the Empress Augusta: “for
fifty years she has been my opponent with the Emperor.”
He lived in an atmosphere of distrust, he
was often insolent, and always suspicious. It affected
all his diplomatic intercourse, and was not at
all to Hohenlohe’s taste. “He handles everything
with a certain arrogance (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Uebermut</i>),” once wrote
Hohenlohe (as we have already said) of a discussion
with him over foreign affairs. “<em>This has always
been his way.</em>”</p>

<p>All these tendencies came to a head when the scepter
passed from the infirm hands of William I to
those of a dying King, around whose death-bed the
military party and the Chancellor’s party began to
intrigue for influence over the young Prince whose
advent to empire was hourly expected. Of these intrigues
Hohenlohe, who was now Statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine,
soon began to feel the effects without
at first discovering the cause. He loved the people
of the Reichsland, was a friend of France, and an
advocate of liberal institutions, and in this spirit he
strove to administer the incorporated territories.
But the military party worked against him, hoping
to secure the abolition of the moderate measure of
local government and Reichstag representation which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the Provinces possessed; and when the latter returned
a hostile majority to the Reichstag they
redoubled their efforts for a policy of “Thorough.”
Bismarck gave but a lukewarm support to Hohenlohe
and insisted on the enforcement of drastic passport
regulations, which, combined with the Schnaebele
affair (on which the Memoirs are very reticent), almost
provoked France to War&mdash;naturally enough,
in the opinion of Hohenlohe, and inevitably, according
to the forebodings of the German Military Attaché
at Paris. To Hohenlohe’s imploring representations
Bismarck replied with grim jests about
Alva’s rule in the Netherlands, adding that it is all
done to show the French “that their noise doesn’t
alarm us.” Meanwhile Switzerland was alienated,
France injured, and Austria suspicious. But Hohenlohe,
after inquiries in Berlin and Baden, began to
discover the reason. Bismarck feared the influence
of the military party over the martial spirit of Prince
William, and was determined to show himself equally
militant in order to secure his dynasty. “His sole
object is to get his son Herbert into the saddle,”
said Bleichroder; “so there is no hope of an improvement
in Alsace-Lorraine,”&mdash;although Prince Herbert
alienated everybody by his insolence, which was
so gross that the Prince of Wales (King Edward),
at this time in Berlin, declared that he could
scarcely restrain himself from showing him the door.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
The leader of the military party, Waldersee, was
hardly more public-spirited. He had, according to
Bismarck, been made Chief of Staff by Moltke, over
the heads of more competent men, because he was
more docile than they. Between these military and
civil autocracies the struggle for the possession of
the present Emperor raged remorselessly, and with
appalling levity they made the peace of two great
nations the pawns in the game. The young Emperor
is seen in Hohenlohe’s Memoirs feeling his
way, groping in the dark; but those who, like the
Grand Duke of Baden, knew the strength of his
character, foresaw the end. At first, he “doesn’t
trust himself to hold a different opinion from Bismarck”;
but, “as soon as he perceives that Bismarck
doesn’t tell him everything,” predicted the
Grand Duke, “there will be trouble.” Meanwhile
Waldersee was working for war, for no better reason
than that he was getting old, and spoiling for a fight
before it was too late for him to take the field.</p>

<p>For Bismarck’s dismissal there were various
causes: differences in domestic policy and in foreign,
and an absolute <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">impasse</i> on the question whether
Bismarck’s fellow-Ministers were to be treated as
colleagues or subordinates. “Bismarck,” said Caprivi
afterwards, “had made a treaty with Russia
by which we guaranteed her a free hand in Bulgaria
and Constantinople, and Russia bound herself to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
remain neutral in a war with France. That would
have meant the shattering of the Triple Alliance.”
Moreover, the relations of Emperor and Chancellor
were, at the last, disfigured by violent scenes, during
which the Kaiser, according to the testimony of every
one, showed the most astonishing dignity and restraint.
But it may all be summed up in the words
of the Grand Duke of Baden, reechoed by the Emperor
to Hohenlohe, it had to be a choice between
the dynasties of Hohenzollern and Bismarck. The
end came to such a period of fear, agony, irony,
despair, recrimination, and catastrophic laughter as
only the pen of a Tacitus could adequately describe.
Bismarck’s last years, both of power and retirement,
were those of a lost soul. Having tried to intrigue
with foreign Ambassadors against his Sovereign before
his retirement, he tried to mobilize the Press
against him after he had retired, and even stooped
to join hands with his old rival, Waldersee, for the
overthrow of his successor, Caprivi, being quite indifferent,
complained the Kaiser bitterly, to what
might happen afterwards. “It is sad to think,”
said the Emperor of Austria to Hohenlohe, “that
such a man can sink so low.”</p>

<p>When Bismarck was dismissed every one raised
his head. It seemed to Hohenlohe to be at last a
case of the beatitude: “the meek shall inherit the
earth.” Holstein, the Under-Secretary, who, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
disgust of Bismarck, refused to follow his chief and
who now quietly made himself the residuary legatee
of the whole political inheritance of the Foreign
Office, intended by Bismarck for his son, freely criticized
his ex-chief’s policy in a conversation with
Hohenlohe:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He adduced as errors of Bismarck’s policy: The
Berlin Congress, the mediation in China in favor of
France, the prevention of the conflict between England
and Russia in Afghanistan, and the whole of his
<em>tracasseries</em> with Russia. As to his recent plan of leaving
Austria in the lurch, he says we should then have
made ourselves so contemptible that we should have become
isolated and dependent on Russia.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Bismarck, whom Hohenlohe visited in his retirement,
with a strange want of patriotism and of perspicuity,
pursued “his favorite theme” and inveighed
against the envy (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">der Neid</i>) of the German
people and their incurable particularism. He never
divined how much his jealous autocracy had fostered
these tendencies. One may hazard the opinion that
the Germans are no more wanting in public spirit
and political capacity than any other nation; but if
they are deprived of the rights of private judgment
and the exercise of political ability, they are no more
likely to be immune from the corresponding disabilities.
Certainly, in no country where public men
are accustomed to the exercise of mutual tolerance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and loyal cooperation by the practise of Cabinet government,
and where public opinion has healthy play,
would such an exhibition of disloyalty and slander
as is here exhibited be tolerated, or even possible.
When in 1895 Caprivi succumbed to the intrigues of
the military caste and the Agrarian Party, Hohenlohe,
now in his seventy-sixth year, was entreated to
come to the rescue, his accession being regarded as
the only security for German unity. To his eternal
credit, Hohenlohe accepted; but, if we may read between
the lines of the scanty extracts here vouchsafed
from the record of a Ministerial activity of
six years, we may conjecture that it was mostly
labor and sorrow. He was opposed to agrarianism
and repressive measures, and anxious “to get on
with the Reichstag,” seeing in the forms of public
discussion the only security for the public peace.
But “the Prussian Junkers could not tolerate South
German Liberalism,” and the most powerful political
caste in the world, with the Army and the King on
their side, appear to have been too much for him.
His retirement in 1900 marks the end of a fugitive
attempt at something like a liberal policy in Germany,
and during the fourteen years which have
elapsed since that event autocracy has held undisputed
sway in Germany. The history of these latter
years is fresh in the minds of most students of public
affairs, and we will not attempt to pursue it here.</p>

<span class="subhead">GERMAN CULTURE<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ACADEMIC GARRISON</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nothing is so characteristic of the German nation
as its astonishing single-mindedness&mdash;using that
term in a mental and not a moral sense. Since Prussia
established her ascendency the nation has developed
an immense concentration of purpose. If the
military men are not more belligerent than the diplomatists,
the diplomatists are not more belligerent
than the professors. A single purpose seems to animate
them: it is to proclaim the spiritual efficacy,
and the eternal necessity, of War.</p>

<p>Already there are signs that the German professors
are taking the field. Their mobilization is apparently
not yet complete, but we may expect before
long to see their whole force, from the oldest Professor
Emeritus down to the youngest <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Privat-dozent</i>,
sharpening their pens against us. Professors Harnack,
Haeckel, and Eucken have already made a
reconnaissance in force, and in language which might
have come straight from the armory of Treitschke
have denounced the mingled cupidity and hypocrisy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
with which we, so they say, have joined forces with
Muscovite “barbarism” against Teutonic culture.
This, we may feel sure, is only the beginning.</p>

<p>German professors have a way of making history
as well as writing it, and the Prussian Government
has always attached the greatest importance to taking
away its enemy’s character before it despoils
him of his goods. Long before the wars of 1866
and 1870 the seminars of the Prussian universities
were as busy forging title-deeds to the smaller German
states and to Alsace-Lorraine as any medieval
scriptorium, and not less ingenious. In the Franco-Prussian
War the professors&mdash;Treitschke, Mommsen,
Sybel&mdash;were the first to take the field and the
last to quit it. Theirs it was to exploit the secular
hatreds of the past. Even Ranke, the nearest approach
to “a good European” of which German
schools of history could boast, was implacable.
When asked by Thiers on whom, the Third Empire
having fallen, the Germans were continuing to make
war, he replied, “On Louis XIV.”</p>

<p>Hardly were the results achieved before a casuistry
was developed to justify them. Sybel’s apologetics
in “Die Begründung des deutschen Reichs” began
it; others have gone far beyond them. “Blessed be
the hand that traced those lines,” is Professor Delbrück’s
benediction on the forgery of the Ems telegram;
and in language which is almost a paraphrase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
of Bismarck’s cynical declaration that a diplomatic
pretext for a war can always be found when you
want one, he has laid it down that “a good diplomat”
should always have his quiver full of such
barbed arrows. So, too, Sybel on Frederick’s complicity
in the Second Partition of an inoffensive
Poland anticipates in almost so many words the recent
sophistry of the Imperial Chancellor on the
violation of the neutrality of Belgium. “Wrong?
I grant you&mdash;a violation of law in the most literal
sense of the word.” But, he adds, necessity knows
no law, and, “to sum it up,” after all, Prussia
“thereby gained a very considerable territory.”
And thus Treitschke on the question of the duchies,
or again, to go farther afield, Mommsen on the inexorable
“law” that the race is always to the swift
and the battle to the strong. Frederick the Great
surely knew his fellow-countrymen when he said with
characteristic cynicism: “I begin by taking; I can
always find pedants to prove my rights afterwards.”
Not the Chancelleries only, but even the General
Staff has worked hand in glove with the lecture-room.
When Bernhardi and von der Goltz exalt the
spiritual efficacy of war they are repeating almost
word for word the language of Treitschke. Not a
faculty but ministers to German statecraft in its
turn. The economists, notably von Halle and Wagner,
have been as busy and pragmatical as the historians&mdash;theirs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
is the doctrine of Prussian military
hegemony upon a basis of agrarianism, of the absorption
of Holland, and of “the future upon the
water.” The very vocabulary of the Kaiser’s
speeches has been coined in the lecture-rooms of
Berlin University.</p>

<p>To understand the potency of these academic influences
in German policy one must know something
of the constitution of the German universities. In
no country is the control of the Government over
the universities so strong; nowhere is it so vigilant.
Political favor may make or mar an academic career;
the complaisant professor is decorated, the contumacious
is cashiered. German academic history is full
of examples. Treitschke, Sybel, even Mommsen all
felt the weight of royal displeasure at one period or
another. The present Emperor vetoed the award of
the Verdun prize to Sybel because in his history of
Prussian policy he had exalted Bismarck at the expense
of the Hohenzollerns, and he threatened to
close the archives to Treitschke. Even Mommsen
had at one time to learn the steepness of alien stairs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, no Government recognizes so
readily the value of a professor who is docile&mdash;he
is of more value than many Pomeranian Grenadiers.
Bismarck invited Treitschke to accompany the army
of Sadowa as a writer of military bulletins, and
both he and Sybel were, after due caution, commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to write those apologetics of Prussian policy
which are classics of their kind. Most German professors
have at one time or another been publicists,
and the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Grenzboten</i> and the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Preussische Jahrbücher</i>
maintain the polemical traditions of Sybel’s “Historische
Zeitschrift.” Moreover, the German university
system, with the singular freedom in the
choice of lectures and universities, which it leaves
to the student, tends to make a professor’s classes
depend for their success on his power of attracting a
public by trenchant oratory. Well has Acton said
that the “garrison” of distinguished historians that
prepared the Prussian supremacy, together with their
own, “hold Berlin like a fortress.” They still hold
it and their science of fortification has not changed.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to recapitulate here the earlier
phases of this politico-historical school whose motto
found expression in Droysen’s aphorism, “The
statesman is the historian in practise,” and whose
moral was “Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht,”
or, to put it less pretentiously, “Nothing
succeeds like success.” All of them, Niebuhr,
Mommsen, Droysen, Häusser, Sybel, Treitschke,
have this in common: that they are merciless to the
rights of small nationalities. This was no accident;
it was due to the magnetism exercised upon their
minds by the hegemony of Prussia and by their
opposition to the idea of a loose confederation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
small States. They were almost equally united in
a common detestation of France and could find no
word too hard for her polity, her literature, her
ideals, and her people. “Sodom” and “Babylon”
were the best they could spare her. “Die Nation
ist unser Feind” wrote Treitschke in 1870, and “we
must draw her teeth.” Even Ranke declared that
everything good in Germany had risen by way of
opposition to French influences. The intellectual
war was carried into every field and epoch of history,
and all the institutions of modern civilization
were traced by writers like Waitz and Maurer to the
early German tribes uncorrupted by Roman influences.
The same spirit was apparent in Sybel’s
hatred of the French Revolution and all its works.</p>

<p>This is not the place to expound the intellectual
revenge which French scholars like Fustel de
Coulanges in the one sphere, and Albert Sorel in the
other, afterwards took upon this insensate chauvinism
of the chair. Sufficient to say that this cult of
war and gospel of hate have narrowed the outlook of
German thought ever since, as Renan warned Strauss
they would, and have left Germany in an intellectual
isolation from the rest of Europe only to be paralleled
by her moral isolation of to-day. It was useless for
Renan to remind German scholars that pride is the
only vice which is punished in this world. “We
Germans,” retorted Mommsen, “are not modest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
don’t pretend to be.” The words are almost the echo
of that “thrasonic brag” with which Bismarck one
day electrified the Reichstag.</p>

<p>In the academic circles of to-day much of the hate
formerly vented upon France is now diverted to England.
In this, Treitschke set the fashion. Nothing
delighted him more than to garnish his immensely
popular lectures with uproarious jests at
England&mdash;“the hypocrite who, with a Bible in one
hand and an opium pipe in the other, scatters over
the universe the benefits of civilization.” But there
was always method in his madness. Treitschke was
one of the first to demand for Germany “a place in
the sun”&mdash;this commonplace of Imperial speeches
was, I believe, coined by Sybel&mdash;and to press for
the creation of a German Navy which should do
what “Europe” had failed to do&mdash;set bounds to
the crushing domination of the British Fleet and
“restore the Mediterranean to the Mediterranean
peoples” by snatching back Malta, Corfu, and
Gibraltar. The seed fell on fruitful soil. A young
economist, the late Professor von Halle, whose vehement
lectures I used to attend when a student at
Berlin University, worked out the maritime possibilities
of German ambitions in “Volks-und Seewirthschaft,”
and his method is highly significant in
view of the recent ultimatum delivered by Germany
to Belgium. It was nothing less than the seduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of Holland by economic bribes into promising
to Germany the abandonment of the neutrality of
her ports in the event of war. Thereby, and thereby
alone, he argued, Germany would be reconciled to
the “monstrosity” (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Unding</i>) of the mouth of the
Rhine being in non-German hands. In return Germany
would take Holland and her colonies under her
“protection.” To the same effect writes Professor
Karl Lamprecht in his “Zur jüngsten deutschen
Vergangenheit,” seizing upon the Boer war to demonstrate
to Holland that England is the enemy. The
same argument was put forward by Professor Lexis.
This was in the true line of academic tradition.
Even the discreet and temperate Ranke once counseled
Bismarck to annex Switzerland.</p>

<p>Such, in briefest outline, is the story of the academic
“garrison.” Of the lesser lansquenets, the
horde of privat-dozents and obscurer professors,
whose intellectual folly is only equaled by their
audacity, and who are the mainstay of the Pan-German
movement, I have said nothing. It may be
doubted whether the second generation can show
anything like the intellectual prestige which, with
all their intemperance, distinguished their predecessors.
But they have all laid to heart Treitschke’s
maxim, “Be governmental,” honor the King, worship
the State, and “believe that no salvation is
possible except by the annihilation of the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
States.” It is a strange ending to the Germany of
Kant and Goethe.</p>

<span class="subhead">GERMAN THOUGHT<br />

<span class="subhead">TREITSCHKE</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a pamphlet of mordant irony addressed to “Messieurs
les Ministres du culte évangélique de l’armée
du roi de Prusse” in the dark days of 1870, Fustel
de Coulanges warned these evangelical camp-followers
of the consequences to German civilization of
their doctrines of a Holy War. “Your error is not
a crime but it makes you commit one, for it leads
you to preach war which is the greatest of all crimes.”
It was not impossible, he added, that that very war
might be the beginning of the decadence of Germany,
even as it would inaugurate the revival of France.
History has proved him a true prophet, but it has
required more than a generation to show with what
subtlety the moral poison of such teaching has penetrated
into German life and character. The great
apostle of that teaching was Treitschke who, though
not indeed a theologian, was characteristically fond
of praying in aid the vocabulary of theology.
“Every intelligent theologian understands perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
well,” he wrote, “that the Biblical saying
‘Thou shalt not kill’ ought no more to be interpreted
literally than the apostolic injunction to give one’s
goods to the poor.” He called in the Old Testament
to redress the balance of the New. “The doctrines
of the apple of discord and of original sin are the
great facts which the pages of History everywhere
reveal.”</p>

<p>To-day, everybody talks of Treitschke, though I
doubt if half a dozen people in England have read
him. His brilliant essays, <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Historische und Politische
Aufsätze</cite>, illuminating almost every aspect of
German controversy, have never been translated;
neither has his <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Politik</cite>, a searching and cynical examination
of the foundations of Political Science
which exalts the State at the expense of Society; and
his <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Deutsche Geschichte</cite>, which was designed to be
the supreme apologetic of Prussian policy, is also
unknown in our tongue. But in Germany their
vogue has been and still is enormous; they are to
Germans what Carlyle and Macaulay were to us.
Treitschke, indeed, has much in common with Carlyle;
the same contempt for Parliaments and constitutional
freedom; the same worship of the strong
man armed; the same somber, almost savage, irony,
and, let it not be forgotten, the same deep moral
fervor. His character was irreproachable. At the
age of fifteen he wrote down this motto for his own:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
“To be always upright, honest, moral, to become a
man, a man useful to humanity, a brave man&mdash;these
are my ambitions.” This high ideal he strove
manfully to realize. But he was a doctrinaire, and
of all doctrinaires the conscientious doctrinaire is
the most dangerous. Undoubtedly, in his case, as
in that of so many other enlightened Germans&mdash;Sybel,
for example&mdash;his apostasy from Liberalism
dated from the moment of his conviction that the
only hope for German unity lay not in Parliaments
but in the military hegemony of Prussia. The
bloody triumphs of the Austro-Prussian War convinced
him that the salvation of Germany was “only
possible by the annihilation of small States,” that
States rest on force, not consent, that success is the
supreme test of merit, and that the issues of war
are the judgment of God. He was singularly free
from sophistry and never attempted, like Sybel, to
defend the Ems telegram by the disingenuous plea
that “an abbreviation is not a falsification”; it
was enough for him that the trick achieved its purpose.
And he had a frank contempt for those Prussian
jurists who attempted to find a legal title to
Schleswig-Holstein; the real truth of the matter
he roundly declared, was that the annexation of the
duchies was necessary for the realization of German
aims. When he writes about war he writes without
any sanctimonious cant:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is not for Germans to repeat the commonplaces of
the apostles of peace or of the priests of Mammon, nor
should they close their eyes before the cruel necessities
of the age. Yes, ours is an epoch of war, our age is an
age of iron. If the strong get the better of the weak,
it is an inexorable law of life. Those wars of hunger
which we still see to-day amongst negro tribes are as
necessary for the economic conditions of the heart of
Africa as the sacred war which a people undertakes to
preserve the most precious belongings of its moral culture.
There as here it is a struggle for life, here for a
moral good, there for a material good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Readers of Bernhardi will recognize here the
source of Bernhardi’s inspiration. If Treitschke
was a casuist at all&mdash;and as a rule he is refreshingly,
if brutally, frank&mdash;his was the supreme
casuistry of the doctrine that the end justifies the
means. That the means may corrupt the end or
become an end in themselves he never saw, or only
saw it at the end of his life. He honestly believed
that war was the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic
enterprise, he feared the commercialism of modern
times, and despised England because he judged
her wars to have always been undertaken with a view
to the conquest of markets. He sneers at the Englishman
who “scatters the blessings of civilization
with a Bible in one hand and an opium pipe in the
other.” He honestly believed that Germany exhibited
a purity of domestic life, a pastoral simplicity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and a deep religious faith to which no European
country could approach, and at the time he
wrote the picture was not overdrawn. He has written
passages of noble and tender sentiment, in which
he celebrates the piety of the peasant, whose religious
exercises were hallowed, wherever the German tongue
was spoken, by the massive faith of Luther’s great
Hymn. Writing of German Protestantism as the
corner-stone of German unity, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Everywhere it has been the solid rampart of our
language and customs. In Alsace, as in the mountains
of Transylvania and on the distant shores of the Baltic,
as long as the peasant shall sing his old canticle</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">German life shall not pass away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who would understand the strength of Treitschke’s
influence on his generation must not lose sight
of these purer elements in his teaching.</p>

<p>But Treitschke was dazzled by the military successes
of Prussia in 1866. With that violent reaction
against culture which is so common among its
professional devotees, and which often makes the men
of the pen far more sanguinary than the men of the
sword, he derided the old Germany of Goethe and
Kant as “a nation of poets and thinkers without a
polity” (“Ein staatloses Volk von Dichtern und
Denkern”), and almost despised his own intellectual
vocation. “Each dragoon,” he cried enviously,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
“who knocks a Croat on the head does far more for
the German cause than the finest political brain that
ever wielded a trenchant pen.” But for his grievous
deafness he would, like his father, have chosen
the profession of arms. Failing that, he chose to
teach. “It is a fine thing,” he wrote, “to be master
of the younger generation,” and he set himself to
indoctrinate it with the aim of German unity. He
taught from 1859 to 1875 successively at Leipzig,
Freiburg, Kiel, and Heidelberg. From 1875 till his
death in 1896 he occupied with immense éclat the
chair of modern history at Berlin. And so, although
a Saxon, he enlisted his pen in the service
of Prussia&mdash;Prussia which always knows how to
attract men of ideas but rarely produces them. In
the great roll of German statesmen and thinkers and
poets&mdash;Stein, Hardenberg, Goethe, Hegel&mdash;you
will look almost in vain for one who is of Prussian
birth. She may pervert them; she cannot create
them.</p>

<p>Treitschke’s views were, of course, shared by many
of his contemporaries. The Seminars of the German
Universities were the arsenals that forged the
intellectual weapons of the Prussian hegemony.
Niebuhr, Ranke, Mommsen, Sybel, Häusser, Droysen,
Gneist&mdash;all ministered to that ascendency,
and they all have this in common&mdash;that they are
merciless to the claims of the small States whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
existence seemed to present an obstacle to Prussian
aims. They are also united in common hatred of
France, for they feared not only the adventures of
Napoleon the Third but the leveling doctrines of
the French Revolution. Burke’s <cite>Letters on a Regicide
Peace</cite> are not more violent against France than
the writings of Sybel, Mommsen, and Treitschke.
What, however, distinguishes Treitschke from his intellectual
confrères is his thoroughness. They made
reservations which he scorned to make. Sybel, for
example, is often apologetic when he comes to the
more questionable episodes in Prussian policy&mdash;the
partition of Poland, the affairs of the duchies,
the Treaty of Bâle, the diplomacy of 1870; Treitschke
is disturbed by no such qualms. Bismarck
who practised a certain economy in giving Sybel access
to official documents for his semi-official history
of Prussian policy, <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die Begründung des deutschen
Reichs</cite>, had much greater confidence in Treitschke
and told him he felt sure he would not be disturbed
to find that “our political linen is not as white as
it might be.” So, too, while others like Mommsen
refused to go the whole way with Bismarck in domestic
policy, and clung to their early Radicalism,
Treitschke had no compunction about absolutism.
He ended, indeed, by becoming the champion of the
Junkers, and his history is a kind of hagiography
of the Hohenzollerns. “Be governmental” was his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
succinct maxim, and he rested his hopes for Germany
on the bureaucracy and the army. Indeed, if
he had had his way, he would have substituted a
unity state for the federal system of the German
Empire, and would have liked to see all Germany an
enlarged Prussia&mdash;“ein erweitertes Preussen”&mdash;a
view which is somewhat difficult to reconcile with his
attacks on France as being “politically in a state of
perpetual nonage,” and on the French Government
as hostile to all forms of provincial autonomy.</p>

<p>By a quite natural transition he was led on from
his championship of the unity of Germany to a conception
of her rôle as a world-power. He is the true
father of Weltpolitik. Much of what he writes on
this head is legitimate enough. Like Hohenlohe and
Bismarck he felt the humiliation of Germany’s weakness
in the councils of Europe. Writing in 1863
he complains:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One thing we still lack&mdash;the State. Our people is
the only one which has no common legislation, which can
send no representatives to the Concert of Europe. No
salute greets the German flag in a foreign port. Our
Fatherland sails the high seas without colors like a pirate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Germany, he declared, must become “a power
across the sea.” This conclusion, coupled with bitter
recollections of the part played by England in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
affair of the Duchies, no doubt accounted for his
growing dislike of England.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Among the English the love of money has killed every
sentiment of honor and every distinction between what
is just and unjust. They hide their poltroonery and
their materialism behind grand phrases of unctuous
theology. When one sees the English press raising its
eyes to heaven, frightened by the audacity of these faithless
peoples in arms upon the Continent, one might imagine
one heard a venerable parson droning away. As
if the Almighty God, in Whose name Cromwell’s Ironsides
fought their battles, commanded us Germans to
allow our enemy to march undisturbed upon Berlin.
Oh, what hypocrisy! Oh, cant, cant, cant!</p></blockquote>

<p>Europe, he says elsewhere, should have put bounds
to the overweening ambition of Britain by bringing
to an end the crushing domination of the English
Fleet at Gibraltar, at Malta, and at Corfu, and by
“restoring the Mediterranean to the Mediterranean
peoples.” Thus did he sow the seeds of German
maritime ambition.</p>

<p>If I were asked to select the most characteristic of
Treitschke’s works I should be inclined to choose
the vehement little pamphlet <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Was fordern wir von
Frankreich?</cite> in which he insisted on the annexation
of Alsace-Lorraine. It is at once the vindication of
Prussian policy, and, in the light of the last forty-four
years, its condemnation. Like Mommsen, who
wrote in much the same strain at the same time, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
insisted that the people of the conquered provinces
must be “forced to be free,” that Morality and History
(which for him are much the same thing)
proclaim they are German without knowing it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We Germans, who know Germany and France, know
better what is good for Alsace than the unhappy people
themselves, who through their French associations have
lived in ignorance of the new Germany. We will give
them back their own identity against their will. We
have in the enormous changes of these times too often
seen in glad astonishment the immortal working of the
moral forces of History (“das unsterbliche Fortwirken
der sittlichen Mächte der Geschichte”) to be able to believe
in the unconditional value of a plebiscite on this
matter. We invoke the men of the past against the
present.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ruthless pedantry of this is characteristically
Prussian. It is easy to appeal to the past against
the present, to the dead against the living. Dead
men tell no tales. It was, he admitted, true that the
Alsatians did not love the Germans. These “misguided
people” betrayed “that fatal impulse of Germans”
to cleave to other nations than their own.
“Well may we Germans be horrified,” he adds,
“when to-day we see these German people rail in
German speech like wild beasts against their own
flesh and blood as ‘German curs’ (‘deutschen
Hunde’) and ‘stink-Prussians’ (‘Stinkpreussen’).”
Treitschke was too honest to deny it. There was, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
ruefully admitted, something rather unlovely about
the “civilizing” methods of Prussia. “Prussia has
perhaps not always been guided by genial men.”
But, he argued, Prussia united under the new Empire
to the rest of Germany would become humanized
and would in turn humanize the new subject-peoples.
Well, the forty-four years that have elapsed since
Treitschke wrote have refuted him. Instead of a
Germanized Prussia, we see a Prussianized Germany.
Her “geniality” is the geniality of Zabern.
The Poles, the Danes, and the Alsatians are still contumacious.
Treitschke appealed to History and History
has answered him.</p>

<p>Had he never any misgivings? Yes. After
twenty-five years, and within a month of his death,
this Hebrew prophet looking round in the year of
grace 1895 on the “culture” of modern Germany
was filled with apprehension. On the twenty-fifth
anniversary of Sedan he delivered an address in the
University of Berlin which struck his fond disciples
dumb. The Empire, he declared, had disarmed her
enemies neither without nor within.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In every direction our manners have deteriorated.
The respect which Goethe declared to be the true end of
all moral education disappears in the new generation
with a giddy rapidity: respect of God, respect for the
limits which nature and society have placed between the
two sexes; respect for the Fatherland, which is every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
day disappearing before the will-of-the-wisp of an indulgent
humanity. The more culture extends, the more
insipid it becomes; men despise the profundity of the
ancient world and consider only that which subserves
their immediate end.</p></blockquote>

<p>The things of the mind, he cried, had lost their
hold on the German people. Every one was eager
to get rich and to relieve the monotony of a vain existence
by the cult of idle and meretricious pleasures.
The signs of the times were everywhere dark
and gloomy. The new Emperor (William the Second),
he had already hinted, was a dangerous charlatan.</p>

<p>The wheel had come full circle. Fustel de
Coulanges was justified of his prophecy. And the
handwriting on the walls of Destiny was never more
legible than now.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_65">CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p>The contemplation of History, so a great master of
the art has told us, may not make men wise but it is
sure to make them sad. The austere Muse has never
had a sadder page to show than that which is even
now being added to her record. We see now the
full fruition of the German doctrine of the beatitude
of War. In sorrow and in anguish, in anguish and
in darkness, Belgium is weeping for her children
and will not be comforted because they are not. The
invader has spared neither age nor sex, neither rank
nor function, and every insult that malice could invent,
or insolence inspire, has been heaped upon
her bowed head. The hearths are cold, the altars
desecrated, the fields untilled, the granaries empty.
The peasant watches the heavens but he may not
sow, he has regarded his fields but he might not reap.
The very stones in her cities cry out; hardly one of
them is left upon another. No nation had ever given
Europe more blithe and winning pledges of her devotion
to the arts of peace. The Flemish school of
painters had endowed the world with portraits of a
grave tenderness which posterity might always admire
but could never imitate. The chisels of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
medieval craftsmen had left us a legacy of buoyant
fancy in stone whose characters were alive for us
with the animation of the Canterbury Tales. All
this the invader has stamped out like the plague. A
once busy and thriving community begs its bread in
alien lands. Never since the captivity of Babylon
has there been so tragic an expatriation. Yet noble
in her sorrow and exalted in her anguish, Belgium,
like some patient caryatid, still supports the broken
architrave of the violated Treaty. Her little army
is still unconquered, her spirit is never crushed. She
will arise purified by her sorrow and ennobled by
her suffering, and generations yet unborn shall rise
up to call her blessed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="h_67">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_1">What is a
State of War.</div>

<p>The armies of belligerent States on the outbreak of
hostilities, or indeed the moment war is declared,
enter into a certain relation with one another which
is known by the name of “A State of War.” This
relationship, which at the beginning only concerns
the members of the two armies, is extended, the moment
the frontier is crossed, to all inhabitants of
the enemy’s State, so far as its territory is occupied;
indeed it extends itself ultimately to both the movable
and immovable property of the State and its
citizens.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_2">Active
Persons and
Passive.</div>

<p>A distinction is drawn between an “active” and a
“passive” state of war. By the first is to be understood
the relation to one another of the actual fighting
organs of the two belligerents, that is to say, of
the persons forming the army, besides that of the
representative heads of the State and of the leaders.
By the second term, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, the “passive” state
of war, on the other hand, is to be understood the
relationship of the hostile army to those inhabitants
of the State, who share in the actual conduct of war
only in consequence of their natural association with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the army of their own State, and who on that account
are only to be regarded as enemies in a passive
sense. As occupying an intermediate position, one
has often to take into account a number of persons
who while belonging to the army do not actually participate
in the conduct of hostilities but continue in
the field to pursue what is to some extent a peaceful
occupation, such as Army Chaplains, Doctors, Medical

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_3">That War is
no Respecter
of Persons.</div>

<p>Now although according to the modern conception
of war, it is primarily concerned with the persons
belonging to the opposing armies, yet no citizen or
inhabitant of a State occupied by a hostile army can
altogether escape the burdens, restrictions, sacrifices,
and inconveniences which are the natural consequence
of a State of War. A war conducted with energy
cannot be directed merely against the combatants of
the Enemy State and the positions they occupy, but
it will and must in like manner seek to destroy the
total intellectual<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and material resources of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
Humanitarian claims such as the protection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
of men and their goods can only be taken into consideration
in so far as the nature and object of the
war permit.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_4">The Usages
of War.</div>

<p>Consequently the “argument of war” permits
every belligerent State to have recourse to all means
which enable it to attain the object of the war; still,
practise has taught the advisability of allowing in
one’s own interest the introduction of a limitation
in the use of certain methods of war and a total renunciation
of the use of others. Chivalrous feelings,
Christian thought, higher civilization and, by
no means least of all, the recognition of one’s own
advantage, have led to a voluntary and self-imposed
limitation, the necessity of which is to-day tacitly
recognized by all States and their armies. They
have led in the course of time, in the simple transmission
of knightly usage in the passages of arms,
to a series of agreements, hallowed by tradition, and
we are accustomed to sum these up in the words
“usage of war” (Kriegsbrauch), “custom of war”
(Kriegssitte), “or fashion of war” (Kriegsmanier).
Customs of this kind have always existed, even in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
times of antiquity; they differed according to the
civilization of the different nations and their public
economy, they were not always identical, even in one
and the same conflict, and they have in the course
of time often changed; they are older than any scientific
law of war, they have come down to us unwritten,
and moreover they maintain themselves in
full vitality; they have therefore won an assured
position in standing armies according as these latter
have been introduced into the systems of almost
every European State.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_5">Of the
futility of
Written
Agreements
as Scraps of
Paper.</div>

<p>The fact that such limitations of the unrestricted
and reckless application of all the available means
for the conduct of war, and thereby the humanization
of the customary methods of pursuing war really
exist, and are actually observed by the armies of all
civilized States, has in the course of the nineteenth
century often led to attempts to develop, to extend,
and thus to make universally binding these preexisting
usages of war; to elevate them to the level
of laws binding nations and armies, in other words to
create a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">codex belli</i>; a law of war. All these attempts
have hitherto, with some few exceptions to be mentioned
later, completely failed. If, therefore, in the
following work the expression “the law of war” is
used, it must be understood that by it is meant not a
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex scripta</i> introduced by international agreements;
but only a reciprocity of mutual agreement; a limitation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of arbitrary behavior, which custom and conventionality,
human friendliness and a calculating
egotism have erected, but for the observance of which
there exists no express sanction, but only “the fear
of reprisals” decides.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_6">The “flabby
emotion” of
Human&shy;itar&shy;ian&shy;ism.</div>

<p>Consequently the usage of war is even now the only
means of regulating the relations of belligerent States
to one another. But with the idea of the usages of
war will always be bound up the character of something
transitory, inconstant, something dependent
on factors outside the army. Nowadays it is not
only the army which influences the spirit of the customs
of war and assures recognition of its unwritten
laws. Since the almost universal introduction of
conscription, the peoples themselves exercise a profound
influence upon this spirit. In the modern
usages of war one can no longer regard merely the
traditional inheritance of the ancient etiquette of
the profession of arms, and the professional outlook
accompanying it, but there is also the deposit of the
currents of thought which agitate our time. But
since the tendency of thought of the last century was
dominated essentially by humanitarian considerations
which not infrequently degenerated into sentimentality
and flabby emotion (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Sentimentalität und
weichlicher Gefühlsschwärmerei</i>) there have not been
wanting attempts to influence the development of
the usages of war in a way which was in fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
contradiction with the nature of war and its object.
Attempts of this kind will also not be wanting in
the future, the more so as these agitations have found
a kind of moral recognition in some provisions of the
Geneva Convention and the Brussels and Hague Conferences.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_7">Cruelty is

<div class="hideb"> </div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_8">The perfect

<p>Moreover the officer is a child of his time. He is
subject to the intellectual<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> tendencies which influence
his own nation; the more educated he is the
more will this be the case. The danger that, in this
way, he will arrive at false views about the essential
character of war must not be lost sight of. The danger
can only be met by a thorough study of war itself.
By steeping himself in military history an
officer will be able to guard himself against excessive
humanitarian notions, it will teach him that certain
severities are indispensable to war, nay more, that
the only true humanity very often lies in a ruthless
application of them. It will also teach him how the
rules of belligerent intercourse in war have developed,
how in the course of time they have solidified
into general usages of war, and finally it will teach
him whether the governing usages of war are justified
or not, whether they are to be modified or
whether they are to be observed. But for a study<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of military history in this light, knowledge of the
fundamental conceptions of modern international
and military movements is certainly necessary. To
present this is the main purpose of the following
work.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHO BELONGS TO THE HOSTILE ARMY?</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_9">Who are
Combatants
and who are
not.</div>

<p>Since the subjects of enemy States have quite different
rights and duties according as they occupy an
active or a passive position, the question arises: Who
is to be recognized as occupying the active position, or
what amounts to the same thing&mdash;Who belongs to
the hostile army? This is a question of particular
importance.</p>

<p>According to the universal usages of war, the following
are to be regarded as occupying an active
position:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. The heads of the enemy’s state and its ministers,
even though they possess no military rank.</p>

<p>2. The regular army, and it is a matter of indifference
whether the army is recruited voluntarily or
by conscription; whether the army consists of
subjects or aliens (mercenaries); whether it is
brought together out of elements which were
already in the service in time of peace, or out of
such as are enrolled at the moment of mobilization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
(militia, reserve, national guard and Landsturm).</p>

<p>3. Subject to certain assumptions, irregular combatants,
also, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, such as are not constituent
parts of the regular army, but have only taken
up arms for the length of the war, or, indeed,
for a particular task of the war.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_10">The Irregular.</div>

<p>Only the third class of persons need be more
closely considered. In their case the question how
far the rights of an active position are to be conceded
to them has at all times been matter of controversy,
and the treatment of irregular troops has
in consequence varied considerably. Generally
speaking the study of military history leads to the
conclusion that the Commanding Officers of regular
armies were always inclined to regard irregular
troops of the enemy with distrust, and to apply to
them the contemporary laws of war with peculiar
severity. This unfavorable prejudice is based on
the ground that the want of a military education and
of stern discipline among irregular troops, easily
leads to transgressions and to non-observance of the
usages of war, and that the minor skirmishes which
they prefer to indulge in, and which by their very
nature lead to individual enterprise, open the door
to irregularity and savagery, and easily deteriorate
into robbery and unauthorized violence, so that in
every case the general insecurity which it develops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
engenders bitterness, fury, and revengeful feelings
in the harassed troops, and leads to cruel reprisals.
Let any one read the combats of the French troops
in the Spanish Peninsula in the years 1808 to 1814,
in Tyrol in 1809, in Germany in 1813, and also
those of the English in their different Colonial wars,
or again the Carlist Wars, the Russo-Turkish War,
and the Franco-Prussian War,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and one will everywhere
find this experience confirmed.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_11">Each State
must decide
for itself.</div>

<p>If these points of view are on the whole decisive
against the employment of irregular troops, yet on
the other hand, it must be left to each particular
State to determine how far it will disregard such
considerations; from the point of view of international
law no State is compelled to limit the instruments
of its military operations to the standing
army. It is, on the contrary, completely justified
in drawing upon all the inhabitants capable of bearing
arms, entirely according to its discretion, and in
imparting to them an authorization to participate in
the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_12">The necessity
of Authorization.</div>

<p>This public authorization has therefore been until
quite recently regarded as the presumed necessary
condition of any recognition of combatant rights.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_13">Exceptions
which prove
the rule.</div>

<div class="hideb"> </div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_14">The Free Lance.</div>

<p>Of course there are numerous examples in military
history in which irregular combatants have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
recognized as combatants by the enemy, without any
public authorization of the kind; thus in the latest
wars of North America, Switzerland, and Italy, and
also in the case of the campaign (without any kind
of commission from a State) of Garibaldi against
Naples and Sicily in the year 1860. But in all these
cases the tacitly conceded recognition originated not
out of any obligatory principles of international law
or of military usage, but simply and solely out of
the fear of reprisals. The power to prevent the entrance
on the scene of these irregular partizans did
not exist, and it was feared that by not recognizing
their quality as combatants the war a cruel character
might be given, and consequently that more harm
than good might result to the parties themselves.
On the other hand there has always been a universal
consensus of opinion against recognizing irregulars
who make their appearance individually or in small
bands, and who conduct war in some measure on
their own account (auf eigene Faust) detached
from the army, and such opinion approves of the punishment
of these offenders with death.</p>

<p>This legal attitude which denies every unauthorized
rising and identifies it with brigandage was
taken up by the revolutionary armies of France towards
the insurrection in La Vendée, and again by
Napoleon in his proceedings against Schill and
Dörnberg in the year 1809, and again by Wellington,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Schwarzenberg, and Blücher, in the Proclamations
issued by them in France in the year 1814,
and the German Army adopted the same standpoint
in the year 1870&ndash;71, when it demanded that:
“Every prisoner who wishes to be treated as a prisoner
of war must produce a certificate as to his character
as a French soldier, issued by the legal authorities,
and addressed to him personally, to the effect
that he has been called to the Colors and is borne on
the Roll of a corps organized on a military footing
by the French Government.”</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_15">Modern
views.</div>

<p>In the controversies which have arisen since the
war of 1870&ndash;71 over the different questions of international
law and the laws of war, decisive emphasis
has no longer been placed upon the question of public
authorization, and it has been proposed, on
grounds of expediency, to recognize as combatants
such irregulars as are indeed without an express
and immediate public authorization, but who are
organized in military fashion and are under a responsible
leader. The view here taken was that by
a recognition of these kind of irregular troops the
dangers and horrors of war would be diminished,
and that a substitute for the legal authorization lacking
in the case of individuals offers itself in the military
organization and in the existence of a leader
responsible to his own State.</p>

<p>Moreover the Brussels Declaration of August 27,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
1874, and in consonance with it the <cite>Manual of the
Institute of International Law</cite>, desire as the first
condition of recognition as combatants “that they
have at their head a personality who is responsible
for the behavior of those under him to his own Government.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_16">The German
Military
View.</div>

<p>Considered from the military point of view there
is not much objection to the omission of the demand
for public authorization, so soon as it becomes a
question of organized detachments of troops, but in
the case of hostile individuals who appear on the
scene we shall none the less be unable to dispense
with the certificate of membership of an organized
band, if such individuals are to be regarded and
treated as lawful belligerents.</p>

<p>But the organization of irregulars in military
bands and their subjection to a responsible leader
are not by themselves sufficient to enable one to
grant them the status of belligerents; even more important
than these is the necessity of being able to
recognize them as such and of their carrying their
arms openly. The soldier must know who he has
against him as an active opponent, he must be protected
against treacherous killing and against any
military operation which is prohibited by the usages
of war among regular armies. The chivalrous idea
which rules in the regular armies of all civilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
States always seeks an open profession of one’s belligerent
character. The demand must, therefore, be
insisted on that irregular troops, although not in
uniform, shall at least be distinguishable by visible
signs which are recognizable at a distance.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Only
by such means can the occurrence of misuse in the
practise of war on the one side, and the tragic consequences
of the non-recognition of combatant status
on the other, be made impossible. The Brussels
Declarations also therefore recommend, in Art. 9
(2 and 3), that they, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, the irregular troops, should
wear a fixed sign which is visible from a distance,
and that they should carry their weapons openly.
The Hague Convention adds to these three conditions
yet a fourth, “That they observe the laws and usages
of war in their military operations.”</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_19">A short way

<p>This condition must also be maintained if it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
a question of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">levée en masse</i>, the arming
of the whole population of the country, province, or
district; in other words the so-called people’s war
or national war.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Starting from the view that one
can never deny to the population of a country the
natural right of defense of one’s fatherland, and
that the smaller and consequently less powerful
States can only find protection in such <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">levées en
masse</i>, the majority of authorities on International
law have, in their proposals for codification, sought
to attain the recognition on principle of the combatant
status of all these kinds of people’s champions,
and in the Brussels declaration and the Hague Regulations
the aforesaid condition<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> is omitted. As
against this one may nevertheless remark that the
condition requiring a military organization and a
clearly recognizable mark of being attached to the
enemy’s troops, is not synonymous with a denial of
the natural right of defense of one’s country. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
therefore not a question of restraining the population
from seizing arms but only of compelling it to
do this in an organized manner. Subjection to a
responsible leader, a military organization, and clear
recognizability cannot be left out of account unless
the whole recognized foundation for the admission
of irregulars is going to be given up altogether, and
a conflict of one private individual against another
is to be introduced again, with all its attendant horrors,
of which, for example, the proceedings in
Bazeilles in the last Franco-Prussian War afford an
instance. If the necessary organization does not
really become established&mdash;a case which is by no
means likely to occur often&mdash;then nothing remains
but a conflict of individuals, and those who conduct
it cannot claim the rights of an active military status.
The disadvantages and severities inherent in such a
state of affairs are more insignificant and less inhuman
than those which would result from recognition.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE MEANS OF CONDUCTING WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_20">Violence and
Cunning.</div>

<p>By the means of conducting war is to be understood
all those measures which can be taken by one State
against the other in order to attain the object of the
war, to compel one’s opponent to submit to one’s will;
they may be summarized in the two ideas of Violence
and Cunning, and judgment as to their applicability
may be embodied in the following proposition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is permissible includes every means of
war without which the object of the war cannot be
obtained; what is reprehensible on the other hand
includes every act of violence and destruction
which is not demanded by the object of war.</p></blockquote>

<p>It follows from these universally valid principles
that wide limits are set to the subjective freedom and
arbitrary judgment of the Commanding Officer; the
precepts of civilization, freedom and honor, the traditions
prevalent in the army, and the general usages
of war, will have to guide his decisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h_85">A.&mdash;MEANS OF WAR DEPENDING ON FORCE</h3>

<p>The most important instruments of war in the possession
of the enemy are his army, and his military
positions; to make an end of them is the first object
of war. This can happen:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. By the annihilation, slaughter, or wounding of the
individual combatants.</p>

<p>2. By making prisoners of the same.</p>

<p>3. By siege and bombardment.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 in0">1. <i>Annihilation, slaughter, and wounding of the hostile
combatants</i></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_21">How to
make an end
of the
Enemy.</div>

<p>In the matter of making an end of the enemy’s
forces by violence it is an incontestable and self-evident
rule that the right of killing and annihilation
in regard to the hostile combatants is inherent
in the war power and its organs, that all means which
modern inventions afford, including the fullest, most
dangerous, and most massive means of destruction,
may be utilized; these last, just because they attain
the object of war as quickly as possible, are on that
account to be regarded as indispensable and, when
closely considered, the most human.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_22">The Rules of
the Game.</div>

<p>As a supplement to this rule, the usages of war
recognize the desirability of not employing severer
forms of violence if and when the object of the war
may be attained by milder means, and furthermore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
that certain means of war which lead to unnecessary
suffering are to be excluded. To such belong:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The use of poison both individually and collectively
(such as poisoning of streams and food supplies<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>) the
propagation of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>Assassination, proscription, and outlawry of an opponent.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The use of arms which cause useless suffering, such as
soft-nosed bullets, glass, etc.</p>

<p>The killing of wounded or prisoners who are no longer
capable of offering resistance.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>The refusal of quarter to soldiers who have laid down
their arms and allowed themselves to be captured.</p></blockquote>

<p>The progress of modern invention has made superfluous
the express prohibition of certain old-fashioned
but formerly legitimate instruments of war (chain
shot, red-hot shot, pitch balls, etc.), since others,
more effective, have been substituted for these; on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
other hand the use of projectiles of less than 400
grammes in weight is prohibited by the St. Petersburg
Convention of December 11th, 1868. (This
only in the case of musketry.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>)</p>

<p>He who offends against any of these prohibitions is
to be held responsible therefore by the State. If he
is captured he is subject to the penalties of military
law.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_23">Colored
Troops are
“Blacklegs.”</div>

<p>Closely connected with the unlawful instruments
of war is the employment of uncivilized and barbarous
peoples in European wars. Looked at from the
point of view of law it can, of course, not be forbidden
to any State to call up armed forces from its
extra-European colonies, but the practise stands in
express contradiction to the modern movement for
humanizing the conduct of war and for alleviating
its attendant sufferings, if men and troops are employed
in war, who are without the knowledge of
civilized warfare and by whom, therefore, the very
cruelties and inhumanities forbidden by the usages
of war are committed. The employment of these
kinds of troops is therefore to be compared with the
use of the instruments of war already described as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
forbidden. The transplantation of African and
Mohammedan Turcos to a European seat of war in
the year 1870 was, therefore, undoubtedly to be regarded
as a retrogression from civilized to barbarous
warfare, since these troops had and could have no
conception of European-Christian culture, or respect
for property and for the honor of women, etc.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p class="p1 in0">2. <i>Capture of Enemy Combatants</i></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_24">Prisoners of
War.</div>

<p>If individual members or parties of the army fall
into the power of the enemy’s forces, either through
their being disarmed and defenseless, or through
their being obliged to cease from hostilities in consequence
of a formal capitulation, they are then in
the position of “prisoners of war,” and thereby in
some measure exchange an active for a passive position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_25">Vae
Victis!</div>

<p>According to the older doctrine of international
law all persons belonging to the hostile State, whether
combatants or non-combatants, who happen to fall
into the hands of their opponent, are in the position
of prisoners of war. He could deal with them according
to his pleasure, ill-treat them, kill them, lead
them away into bondage, or sell them into slavery.
History knows but few exceptions to this rule, these
being the result of particular treaties. In the Middle
Ages the Church tried to intervene as mediator
in order to ameliorate the lot of the prisoners, but
without success. Only the prospect of ransom, and
chivalrous ideas in the case of individuals, availed to
give any greater protection. It is to be borne in
mind that the prisoners belonged to him who had
captured them, a conception which began to disappear
after the Thirty Years’ War. The treatment of
prisoners of war was mostly harsh and inhuman;
still, in the seventeenth century, it was usual to
secure their lot by a treaty on the outbreak of a war.</p>

<p>The credit of having opened the way to another
conception of war captivity belongs to Frederick the
Great and Franklin, inasmuch as they inserted in
the famous Treaty of friendship, concluded in 1785
between Prussia and North America, entirely new
regulations as to the treatment of prisoners of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_26">The Modern
View.</div>

<p>The complete change in the conception of war introduced
in recent times has in consequence changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
all earlier ideas as to the position and treatment of
prisoners of war. Starting from the principle that
only States and not private persons are in the position
of enemies in time of war, and that an enemy
who is disarmed and taken prisoner is no longer an
object of attack, the doctrine of war captivity is entirely
altered and the position of prisoners has become
assimilated to that of the wounded and the
sick.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_27">Prisoners of
War are to
be honorably
treated.</div>

<p>The present position of international law and the
law of war on the subject of prisoners of war is
based on the fundamental conception that they are
the captives not of private individuals, that is to
say of Commanders, Soldiers, or Detachments of
Troops, but that they are the captives of the State.
But the State regards them as persons who have
simply done their duty and obeyed the commands
of their superiors, and in consequence views their
captivity not as penal but merely as precautionary.</p>

<p>It therefore follows that the object of war captivity
is simply to prevent the captives from taking
any further part in the war, and that the State can,
in fact, do everything which appears necessary for
securing the captives, but nothing beyond that. The
captives have therefore to submit to all those restrictions
and inconveniences which the purpose of securing
them necessitates; they can collectively be
involved in a common suffering if some individuals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
among them have provoked sterner treatment; but,
on the other hand, they are protected against unjustifiable
severities, ill-treatment, and unworthy
handling; they do, indeed, lose their freedom, but
not their rights; war captivity is, in other words, no
longer an act of grace on the part of the victor but
a right of the defenseless.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_28">Who may be
made Prisoners.</div>

<p>According to the notions of the laws of war to-day
the following persons are to be treated as prisoners
of war:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. The Sovereign, together with those members of his
family who were capable of bearing arms, the
chief of the enemy’s State, generally speaking,
and the Ministers who conduct its policy even
though they are not among the individuals belonging
to the active army.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>2. All persons belonging to the armed forces.</p>

<p>3. All Diplomatists and Civil Servants attached to
the army.</p>

<p>4. All civilians staying with the army, with the approval
of its Commanders, such as transport,
sutlers, contractors, newspaper correspondents,
and the like.</p>

<p>5. All persons actively concerned with the war such as
Higher Officials, Diplomatists, Couriers, and the
like, as also all those persons whose freedom can
be a danger to the army of the other State, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
example, Journalists of hostile opinions, prominent
and influential leaders of Parties, Clergy
who excite the people, and such like.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>6. The mass of the population of a province or a district
if they rise in defense of their country.</p></blockquote>

<p>The points of view regarding the treatment of
prisoners of war may be summarized in the following
rules:</p>

<p>Prisoners of war are subject to the laws of the
State which has captured them.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_29">The treatment
of Prisoners
of War.</div>

<p>The relation of the prisoners of war to their own
former superiors ceases during their captivity; a captured
officer’s servant steps into the position of a private
servant. Captured officers are never the superiors
of soldiers of the State which has captured
them; on the contrary, they are under the orders
of such of the latter as are entrusted with their
custody.</p>

<p>The prisoners of war have, in the places in which
they are quartered, to submit to such restrictions of
their liberty as are necessary for their safe keeping.
They have strictly to comply with the obligation imposed
upon them, not to move beyond a certain indicated
boundary.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_30">Their confinement.</div>

<p>These measures for their safe keeping are not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
be exceeded; in particular, penal confinement, fetters,
and unnecessary restrictions of freedom are
only to be resorted to if particular reasons exist to
justify or necessitate them.</p>

<p>The concentration camps in which prisoners of
war are quartered must be as healthy, clean, and decent
as possible; they should not be prisons or convict
establishments.</p>

<p>It is true that the French captives were transported
by the Russians to Siberia as malefactors in
the years 1812 and 1813. This was a measure
which was not illegitimate according to the older
practise of war, but it is no longer in accordance
with the legal conscience of to-day. Similarly the
methods which were adopted during the Civil War
in North America in a prison in the Southern States,
against prisoners of war of the Union Forces, whereby
the men were kept without air and nourishment and
thus badly treated, were also against the practise of
the law of war.</p>

<p>Freedom of movement within these concentration
camps or within the whole locality may be permitted
if there are no special reasons against it. But obviously
prisoners of war are subject to the existing,
or to the appointed rules of the establishment or
garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_31">The Prisoner
and his
Taskmaster.</div>

<p>Prisoners of war can be put to moderate work proportionate
to their position in life; work is a safeguard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
against excesses. Also on grounds of health
this is desirable. But these tasks should not be
prejudicial to health nor in any way dishonorable or
such as contribute directly or indirectly to the military
operations against the Fatherland of the captives.
Work for the State is, according to the
Hague regulations, to be paid at the rates payable to
members of the army of the State itself.</p>

<p>Should the work be done on account of other public
authorities or of private persons, then the conditions
will be fixed by agreement with the military authorities.
The wages of the prisoners of war must
be expended in the improvement of their condition,
and anything that remains should be paid over to
them after deducting the cost of their maintenance
when they are set free. Voluntary work in order
to earn extra wages is to be allowed, if there are no
particular reasons against it.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Insurrection, insubordination,
misuse of the freedom granted, will of
course justify severer confinement in each case, also
punishment, and so will crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_32">Flight.</div>

<p>Attempts at escape on the part of individuals who
have not pledged their word of honor might be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
as the expression of a natural impulse for
liberty, and not as a crime. They are therefore to
be punished by restriction of the privileges granted
and a sharper supervision but not with death. But
the latter punishment will follow of course in the
case of plots to escape, if only because of the danger
of them. In case of a breach of a man’s parole the
punishment of death may reasonably be incurred.
In some circumstances, if necessity and the behavior
of the prisoners compel it, one is justified in taking
measures the effect of which is to involve the innocent
with the guilty.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_33">Diet.</div>

<p>The food of the prisoners must be sufficient and
suitable to their rank, yet they will have to be content
with the customary food of the country; luxuries
which the prisoners wish to get at their own
expense are to be permitted if reasons of discipline
do not forbid.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_34">Letters.</div>

<p>Correspondence with one’s home is to be permitted,
likewise visits and intercourse, but these of course
must be watched.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_35">Personal
belongings.</div>

<p>The prisoners of war remain in possession of their
private property with the exception of arms, horses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and documents of a military purport. If for definite
reasons any objects are taken away from them,
then these must be kept in suitable places and restored
to them at the end of their captivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_36">The Information
Bureau.</div>

<p>Article 14 of the Hague Regulations prescribes
that on the outbreak of hostilities there shall be established
in each of the belligerent States and in a
given case in neutral States, which have received
into their territory any of the combatants, an
information bureau for prisoners of war. Its duty
will be to answer all inquiries concerning such prisoners
and to receive the necessary particulars from
the services concerned in order to be able to keep a
personal entry for every prisoner. The information
bureau must always be kept well posted about everything
which concerns a prisoner of war. Also this
information bureau must collect and assign to the
legitimate persons all personal objects, valuables, letters,
and the like, which are found on the field of
battle or have been left behind by dead prisoners
of war in hospitals or field-hospitals. The information
bureau enjoys freedom from postage, as do generally
all postal despatches sent to or by prisoners
of war. Charitable gifts for prisoners of war must
be free of customs duty and also of freight charges
on the public railways.</p>

<p>The prisoners of war have, in the event of their
being wounded or sick, a claim to medical assistance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and care as understood by the Geneva Convention
and, so far as is possible, to spiritual ministrations
also.</p>

<p>These rules may be shortly summarized as follows:</p>

<p>Prisoners of war are subject to the laws of the
country in which they find themselves, particularly
the rules in force in the army of the local State;
they are to be treated like one’s own soldiers, neither
worse nor better.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_37">When Prisoners
may
be put to
Death.</div>

<p>The following considerations hold good as regard
the imposition of a death penalty in the case of prisoners;
they can be put to death:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. In case they commit offenses or are guilty of practises
which are punishable by death by civil or
military laws.</p>

<p>2. In case of insubordination, attempts at escape, etc.,
deadly weapons can be employed.</p>

<p>3. In case of overwhelming necessity, as reprisals,
either against similar measures, or against other
irregularities on the part of the management of
the enemy’s army.</p>

<p>4. In case of overwhelming necessity, when other
means of precaution do not exist and the existence
of the prisoners becomes a danger to one’s
own existence.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_38">“Reprisals.”</div>

<p>As regards the admissibility of reprisals, it is to
be remarked that these are objected to by numerous
teachers of international law on grounds of humanity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
To make this a matter of principle, and apply it to
every case exhibits, however, “a misconception due
to intelligible but exaggerated and unjustifiable feelings
of humanity, of the significance, the seriousness
and the right of war. It must not be overlooked
that here also the necessity of war, and the safety of
the State are the first consideration, and not regard
for the unconditional freedom of prisoners from
molestation.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_39">One must
not be too
scrupulous.</div>

<p>That prisoners should only be killed in the event
of extreme necessity, and that only the duty of self-preservation
and the security of one’s own State can
justify a proceeding of this kind is to-day universally
admitted. But that these considerations have not
always been decisive is proved by the shooting of
2,000 Arabs at Jaffa in 1799 by Napoleon; of the
prisoners in the rising of La Vendée; in the Carlist
War; in Mexico, and in the American War of Secession,
where it was generally a case of deliverance
from burdensome supervision and the difficulties of
maintenance; whereas peoples of a higher morality
such as the Boers in our own days, finding themselves
in a similar position, have preferred to let
their prisoners go. For the rest, calamities such as
might lead to the shooting of prisoners are scarcely
likely to happen under the excellent conditions of
transport in our own time and the correspondingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
small difficulty of feeding them&mdash;in a European
campaign.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_40">The end of
Captivity.</div>

<p>The captivity of war comes to an end:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. By force of circumstances which <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> determine
it, for example, successful escape, cessation of
the war, or death.</p>

<p>2. By becoming the subject of the enemy’s state.</p>

<p>3. By release, whether conditional or unconditional,
unilateral or reciprocal.</p>

<p>4. By exchange.</p></blockquote>

<p>As to 1. With the cessation of the war every reason
for the captivity ceases, provided there exist no
special grounds for another view. It is on that account
that care should be taken to discharge prisoners
immediately. There remain only prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
sentenced to punishment or awaiting trial, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, until
the expiation of their sentence or the end of their
trial as the case may be.</p>

<p>As to 2. This pre-supposes the readiness of the
State to accept the prisoner as a subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_41">Parole.</div>

<p>As to 3. A man released under certain conditions
has to fulfil them without question. If he does not
do this, and again falls into the hands of his enemy,
then he must expect to be dealt with by military law,
and indeed according to circumstances with the punishment
of death. A conditional release cannot be
imposed on the captive; still less is there any obligation
upon the state to discharge a prisoner on conditions&mdash;for
example, on his parole. The release depends
entirely on the discretion of the State, as does
also the determination of its limits and the persons
to whom it shall apply.</p>

<p>The release of whole detachments on their parole
is not usual. It is rather to be regarded as an arrangement
with each particular individual.</p>

<p>Arrangements of this kind, every one of which is
as a rule made a conditional discharge, must be very
precisely formulated and the wording of them most
carefully scrutinized. In particular it must be precisely
expressed whether the person released is only
bound no longer to fight directly with arms against
the State which releases him, in the present war,
whether he is justified in rendering services to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
own country in other positions or in the colonies, etc.,
or whether all and every kind of service is forbidden
him.</p>

<p>The question whether the parole given by an officer
or a soldier is recognized as binding or not by
his own State depends on whether the legislation or
even the military instructions permit or forbid the
giving of one’s parole.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> In the first case his own
State must not command him to do services the performance
of which he has pledged himself not to
undertake.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> But personally the man released on
parole is under all circumstances bound to observe
it. He destroys his honor if he breaks his word,
and is liable to punishment if recaptured, even
though he has been hindered by his own State from
keeping it.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> According to the Hague Regulations a
Government can demand no services which are in
conflict with a man’s parole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_42">Exchange of
Prisoners.</div>

<p>As to 4. The exchange of prisoners in a single
case can take place between two belligerents without
its being necessary in every case to make circumstantial
agreements. As regards the scope of the exchange
and the forms in which it is to be completed
the Commanding Officers on both sides alone decide.
Usually the exchange is man for man, in which case
the different categories of military persons are taken
into account and certain ratios established as to what
constitutes equivalents.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_43">Removal of
Prisoners.</div>

<p>Transport of Prisoners.&mdash;Since no Army makes
prisoners in order to let them escape again afterwards,
measures must be taken for their transport in order
to prevent attempts at escape. If one recalls that in
the year 1870&ndash;71, no fewer than 11,160 officers
and 333,885 men were brought from France to Germany,
and as a result many thousands often had to
be guarded by a proportionately small company, one
must admit that in such a position only the most
zealous energy and ruthless employment of all the
means at one’s disposal can avail, and although it is
opposed to military sentiment to use weapons against
the defenseless, none the less in such a case one has
no other choice. The captive who seeks to free himself
by flight does so at his peril and can complain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of no violence which the custody of prisoners directs
in order to prevent behavior of that kind. Apart
from these apparently harsh measures against attempt
at escape, the transport authorities must do
everything they can to alleviate the lot of the sick
and wounded prisoners, in particular they are to
protect them against insults and ill-treatment from
an excited mob.</p>

<p class="p1 in0">3. <i>Sieges and Bombardments</i></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_44">Fair Game.</div>

<p>War is waged not merely with the hostile combatants
but also with the inanimate military resources
of the enemy. This includes not only the fortresses
but also every town and every village which is an
obstacle to military progress. All can be besieged
and bombarded, stormed and destroyed, if they are
defended by the enemy, and in some cases even if they
are only occupied. There has always been a divergence
of views, among Professors of International Law,
as to the means which are permissible for waging
war against these inanimate objects, and these views
have frequently been in strong conflict with those of
soldiers; it is therefore necessary to go into this
question more closely.</p>

<p>We have to distinguish:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Fortresses, strong places, and fortified places.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Open towns, villages, buildings, and the like,
which, however, are occupied or used for military
purposes.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Fortresses and strong places are important centers
of defense, not merely in a military sense, but
also in a political and economic sense. They furnish
a principal resource to the enemy and can therefore
be bombarded just like the hostile army itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_45">Of making
the most of
one’s opportunity.</div>

<p>A preliminary notification of bombardment is just
as little to be required as in the case of a sudden
assault. The claims to the contrary put forward by
some jurists are completely inconsistent with war
and must be repudiated by soldiers; the cases in
which a notification has been voluntarily given do
not prove its necessity. The besieger will have to
consider for himself the question whether the very
absence of notification may not be itself a factor of
success, by means of surprise, and indeed whether
notification will not mean a loss of precious time.
If there is no danger of this then humanity no doubt
demands such a notification.</p>

<p>Since town and fortifications belong together and
form an inseparable unity, and can seldom in a military
sense, and never in an economic and political
sense, be separated, the bombardment will not limit
itself to the actual fortification, but it will and must
extend over the whole town; the reason for this lies
in the fact that a restriction of the bombardment
to the fortifications is impracticable; it would
jeopardize the success of the operation, and would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
quite unjustifiably protect the defenders who are
not necessarily quartered in the works.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_46">Spare the
Churches.</div>

<p>But this does not preclude the exemption by the
besieger of certain sections and buildings of the fortress
or town from bombardment, such as churches,
schools, libraries, museums, and the like, so far as
this is possible.</p>

<p>But of course it is assumed that buildings seeking
this protection will be distinguishable and that
they are not put to defensive uses. Should this happen,
then every humanitarian consideration must
give way. The utterances of French writers about the
bombardments of Strasburg Cathedral in the year
1870, are therefore quite without justification, since
it only happened after an observatory for officers of
artillery had been erected on the tower.</p>

<p>The only exemption from bombardment recognized
by international law, through the medium of the
Geneva Convention, concerns hospitals and convalescent
establishments. Their extension is left to the
discretion of the besieger.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_47">A Bombardment
is no
Respecter of
Persons.</div>

<p>As regards the civil population of a fortified place
the rule is: All the inhabitants, whether natives or
foreigners, whether permanent or temporary residents,
are to be treated alike.</p>

<p>No exception need be made in regard to the diplomatists
of neutral States who happen to be in the
town; if before or during the investment by the besieger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
their attention is drawn to the fate to which
they expose themselves by remaining, and if days of
grace in which to leave are afforded them, that simply
rests on the courtesy of the besieger. No such duty
is incumbent upon him in international law. Also
permission to send out couriers with diplomatic despatches
depends entirely upon the discretion of the
besieger. In any case it will always depend on
whether the necessary security against misuse is provided.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_48">A timely
severity.</div>

<p>If the commandant of a fortress wishes to
strengthen its defensive capacity by expelling a portion
of the population such as women, children, old
people, wounded, etc., then he must take these steps
in good time, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, before the investment begins. If
the investment is completed, no claim to the free
passage of these classes can be made good. All juristic
demands to the contrary are as a matter of principle
to be repudiated, as being in fundamental conflict
with the principles of war. The very presence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of such persons may accelerate the surrender of
the place in certain circumstances, and it would
therefore be foolish of a besieger to renounce voluntarily
this advantage.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Once the surrender of a fortress is accomplished,
then, by the usages of war to-day, any further destruction,
annihilation, incendiarism, and the like,
are completely excluded. The only further injuries
that are permitted are those demanded or necessitated
by the object of the war, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">e.g.</i>, destruction of fortifications,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
removal of particular buildings, or in some circumstances
of complete quarters, rectification of the
foreground and so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_49">“Undefended
Places.”</div>

<p>A prohibition by international law of the bombardment
of open towns and villages which are not occupied
by the enemy, or defended, was, indeed, put
into words by the Hague Regulations, but appears
superfluous, since modern military history knows of
hardly any such case.</p>

<p>But the matter is different where open towns are
occupied by the enemy or are defended. In this
case, naturally all the rules stated above as to fortified
places hold good, and the simple rules of tactics
dictate that fire should be directed not merely against
the bounds of the place, so that the space behind the
enemy’s firing line and any reserves that may be
there shall not escape. A bombardment is indeed
justified, and unconditionally dictated by military
consideration, if the occupation of the village is not
with a view to its defense but only for the passage of
troops, or to screen an approach or retreat, or to prepare
or cover a tactical movement, or to take up supplies,
etc. The only criterion is the value which the
place possesses for the enemy in the existing situation.</p>

<p>Regarding it from this point of view, the bombardment
of Kehl by the French in 1870 was justified by
military necessity, although the place bombarded was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
an open town and not directly defended. “Kehl
offered the attacking force the opportunity of establishing
itself in its buildings, and of bringing up and
placing there its personnel and material, unseen by
the defenders. It became a question of making Kehl
inaccessible to the enemy and of depriving it of the
characteristics which made its possession advantageous
to the enemy. The aforesaid justification was
not very evident.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Also the bombardment of the open town of Saarbrücken
cannot from the military point of view be the
subject of reproach against the French. On August
2nd a Company of the Fusilier Regiment No. 40
had actually occupied the railway station and several
others had taken up a position in the town. It was
against these troops that the fire of the French was
primarily directed. If havoc was spread in the town,
that could scarcely be avoided. In the night of
August 3rd to 4th, the fire of the French batteries
was again directed on the railway station in order to
prevent the despatch of troops and material.
Against this proceeding also no objection can be
made, since the movement of trains had actually
taken place.</p>

<p>If, therefore, on the German side<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> energetic protest
were made in both cases, and the bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of Kehl and Saarbrücken were declared a violation
of international law, this only proves that in 1870 a
proper comprehension of questions of the laws of
war of this kind was not always to be found even
in the highest military and official circles. But still
less was this the case on the French side as is clear
from the protests against the German bombardment
of Dijon, Chateaudun, Bazeilles, and other places,
the military justification for which is still clearer
and incontestable.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<h3 id="h_110">B.&mdash;METHODS NOT INVOLVING THE USE OF FORCE.
CUNNING, AND DECEIT</h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_50">Stratagems.</div>

<p>Cunning in war has been permissible from the
earliest times, and was esteemed all the more as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
furthered the object of war without entailing the

attacks and retreats, feigned flight, pretense of inactivity,

take the form of faithlessness, fraud, and breach of

of a free retirement; or of an armistice, in
order to gain by a surprise attack an advantage over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the enemy; feigned surrender in order to kill the
enemy who then approach unsuspiciously; misuse of
a flag of truce, or of the Red Cross, in order to secure
one’s approach, or in case of attack, deliberate
violation of a solemnly concluded obligation, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">e.g.</i>, of

against the law of nations even in the earliest times.
The natural conscience of mankind whose spirit is

<span class="subhead">TREATMENT OF WOUNDED AND SICK SOLDIERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The generally accepted principle that in war one
should do no more harm to one’s enemy than the object
of the war unconditionally requires, has led to treating
the wounded and sick combatants as being no
longer enemies, but merely sick men who are to be
taken care of and as much as possible protected from
the tragic results of wounds and illness. Although
endeavors to protect the wounded soldiers from arbitrary
slaughter, mutilation, ill-treatment, or other
brutalities go back to the oldest times, yet the credit
of systematizing these endeavors belongs to the nineteenth
century, and this system was raised to the
level of a principle of international law by the
Geneva Convention of 1864.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_57">The sanctity
of the
Geneva Convention.</div>

<p>With the elevation of the Geneva Agreements to
the level of laws binding peoples and armies, the
question of the treatment of wounded and sick combatants,
as well as that of the persons devoted to the
healing and care of them, is separated from the
usages of war. Moreover, and discussion of the
form of this international law must be regarded from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the military point of view as aimless and unprofitable.
The soldier may still be convinced that some
of the Articles are capable of improvement, that
others need supplementing, and that yet others should
be suppressed, but he has not the right to deviate
from the stipulations; it is his duty to contribute as
far as he can to the observance of the whole code.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_58">The
“Hyenas of
the Battlefield.”</div>

<p>No notice is taken in the Geneva Convention of
the question of the protection of fallen or wounded
combatants from the front, from the rabble usually
known as “The Hyenas of the battlefield,” who are
accustomed to rob, ill-treat, or slay soldiers lying
defenseless on the field of battle. This is a matter
left to the initiative of the troops. Persons of this
kind, whether they be soldiers or not, are undoubtedly
to be dealt with in the sternest possible manner.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTERCOURSE BETWEEN BELLIGERENT ARMIES</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_59">Flags of
Truce.</div>

<p>Hostile armies are in frequent intercourse with one
another. This takes place so long as it is practised
openly, that is to say, with the permission of the
commanders on both sides, by means of bearers of
flags of truce. In this class are included those who
have to conduct the official intercourse between the
belligerent armies or divisions thereof, and who appear
as authorized envoys of one army to the other, in
order to conduct negotiations and to transmit communications.
As to the treatment of bearers of
flags of truce there exist regular usages of war, an
intimate acquaintance with which is of the highest
practical importance. This knowledge is not merely
indispensable for the higher officers, but also for all
inferior officers, and to a certain extent for the private
in the ranks.</p>

<p>Since a certain degree of intercourse between the
two belligerents is unavoidable, and indeed desirable,
the assurance of this intercourse is in the interests
of both parties; it has held good as a custom from
the earliest times, and even among uncivilized people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
whereby these envoys and their assistants
(trumpeter, drummer, interpreter, and orderly) are
to be regarded as inviolable; a custom which proceeds
on the presumption that these persons, although
drawn from the ranks of the combatants, are
no longer, during the performance of these duties,
to be regarded as active belligerents. They must,
therefore, neither be shot nor captured; on the contrary,
everything must be done to assure the performance
of their task and to permit their return on its
conclusion.</p>

<p>But it is a fundamental condition of this procedure:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. That the envoy be quite distinguishable as such by
means of universally recognized and well-known
marks; distinguishable both by sight and by
hearing (flags of truce, white flags, or, if need
be, white pocket-handkerchiefs) and signals
(horns or bugles).</p>

<p>2. That the envoy behave peaceably, and</p>

<p>3. That he does not abuse his position in order to
commit any unlawful act.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course any contravention of the last two conditions
puts an end to his inviolability; it may justify
his immediate capture, and, in extreme cases (espionage,
hatching of plots), his condemnation by military
law. Should the envoy abuse his mission for
purposes of observation, whereby the army he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
visiting is imperiled, then also he may be detained,
but not longer than is necessary. In all cases of
this kind it is recommended that prompt and detailed
information be furnished to the head of the
other army.</p>

<p>It is the right of every army:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. To accept, or to refuse such envoys. An envoy who
is not received must immediately rejoin his own
army; he must not, of course, be shot at on his
way.</p>

<p>2. To declare that it will not during a fixed period
entertain any envoys. Should any appear in
spite of this declaration; they cannot claim to
be inviolable.</p>

<p>3. To determine in what forms and under what precautions
envoys shall be received. The envoys
have to submit to any commands even though
entailing personal inconvenience such as blindfolding
or going out of their way on coming or
returning, and such like.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_60">The
Etiquette of
Flags of
Truce.</div>

<p>The observance of certain forms in the reception of
envoys is of the greatest importance, as a parley may
serve as a cloak for obtaining information or for the
temporary interruption of hostilities and the like.
Such a danger is particularly likely to occur if the
combatants have been facing one another, as in the
case of a war of positions, for a long time without
any particular result. These forms are also important
because their non-observance, as experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
shows, gives rise to recrimination and charges of
violation of the usages of war. The following may,
therefore, be put forward as the chief rules for the
behavior of an envoy and as the forms to be observed
in his reception.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_61">The Envoy.</div>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. The envoy (who is usually selected as being a man
skilled in languages and the rules, and is
mounted on horseback) makes for the enemy’s
outpost or their nearest detachment, furnished
with the necessary authorization, in the company
of a trumpeter and a flag-bearer on horseback.
If the distance between the two outposts of the
respective lines is very small, then the envoy
may go on foot in the company of a bugler or a
drummer.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_62">His approach.</div>

<p>2. When he is near enough to the enemy’s outposts or
their lines to be seen and heard, he has the
trumpet or bugle blown and the white flag unfurled
by the bearer. The bearer will seek to
attract the attention of the enemy’s outposts or
detachments whom he has approached, by waving
the flag to and fro.</p>

<p class="in1">From this moment the envoy and his company are
inviolable, in virtue of a general usage of war.
The appearance of a flag of truce in the middle
of a fight, however, binds no one to cease fire.
Only the envoy and his companions are not to
be shot at.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_63">The challenge&mdash;“Wer
da?”</div>

<p>3. The envoy now advances with his escort at a slow
walk to the nearest posted officer. He must
obey the challenge of the enemy’s outposts and
patrol.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote" id="sn_64">His reception.</div>

<p>4. Since it is not befitting to receive an envoy at just
that place which he prefers, he has to be ready
to be referred to a particular place of admission.
He must keep close to the way prescribed for
him. It is advisable for the enemy whenever
this is possible to give the envoy an escort on
the way.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_65">He dismounts.</div>

<p>5. On arriving at the place indicated, the envoy dismounts
along with his attendants; leaves them at
a moderate distance behind him, and proceeds on
foot to the officer on duty, or highest in command,
at that place, in order to make his wishes
known.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_66">Let his Yea
be Yea, and
his Nay, Nay.</div>

<p>6. Intercourse with the enemy’s officer must be courteously
conducted. The envoy has always to bear
in mind the discharge of his mission, to study
the greatest circumspection in his conversations,
neither to attempt to sound the enemy or to allow
himself to be sounded.... The best thing
is to refuse to enter into any conversation on
military matters beforehand.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_67">The duty of
his Interlocutor.</div>

<p>7. For less important affairs the officer at the place
of admission will possess the necessary instructions,
in order either to discharge them himself,
or to promise their discharge in a fixed period.
But in most cases the decision of a superior will
have to be taken; in this case the envoy has to
wait until the latter arrives.</p>

<p>8. If the envoy has a commission to deal personally
with the Commander-in-Chief or a high officer,
or if the officer on duty at the place of admission
considers it desirable for any reason to send
the envoy back, then, if it be necessary, the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
of the envoy may be blindfolded; to take away
his weapons is hardly necessary. If the officer
at the place of admission is in any doubt what
attitude to adopt towards the requests of the envoy,
he will for the time being detain him at his
post, and send an intimation to his immediate
superior in case the affair appears to him of particular
importance, and at the same time to the
particular officer to whom the envoy is or should
be sent.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_68">The impatient
Envoy.</div>

<p>9. If an envoy will not wait, he may be permitted,
according to circumstances, to return to his own
army if the observation made by him or any
communications received can no longer do any
harm.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the foregoing it follows that intercourse with
the envoys of an enemy presupposes detailed instructions
and a certain intelligence on the part of the
officers and men if it is to proceed peaceably. But
before all things it must be made clear to the men that
the intentional wounding or killing of an envoy is a
serious violation of international law, and that even
an unfortunate accident which leads to such a violation
may have the most disagreeable consequences.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_69">The French
again.</div>

<p>A despatch of Bismarck’s of January 9th, 1871,
demonstrates by express mention of their names, that
twenty-one German envoys were shot by French soldiers
while engaged on their mission. Ignorance and
defective teaching of the troops may have been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
principal reason for this none too excusable behavior.
In many cases transgressions on the part of the
rawer elements of the army may have occurred, as
has been many times offered as an excuse in higher
quarters. Nevertheless, this state of affairs makes
clear the necessity of detailed instruction and a sharp
supervision of the troops by the officers.</p>

<span class="subhead">SCOUTS AND SPIES</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_70">The Scout.</div>

<div class="hideb"> </div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_71">The Spy
and his short
shrift.</div>

<p>Scouting resolves itself into a question of getting
possession of important information about the position,
strength, plans, etc., of the enemy, and thereby
promoting the success of one’s own side. The existence
of scouting has been closely bound up with warfare
from the earliest times; it is to be regarded as
an indispensable means of warfare and consequently
is undoubtedly permissible. If the scouting takes
place publicly by recognizable combatants then it is
a perfectly regular form of activity, against which
the enemy can only use the regular means of defense,
that is to say, killing in battle, and capture. If the
scouting takes the form of secret or surreptitious
methods, then it is espionage, and is liable to particularly
severe and ruthless measures by way of
precaution and exemplary punishment&mdash;usually
death by shooting or hanging. This severe punishment
is not inflicted on account of dishonorable disposition
on the part of the spy&mdash;there need exist
nothing of the kind, and the motive for the espionage
may arise from the highest patriotism and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
sentiment of military duty quite as often as from
avarice and dishonorable cupidity<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>&mdash;but principally
on account of the particular danger which lies in
such secret methods. It is as it were a question of
self-defense.</p>

<p>Having regard to this severe punishment introduced
by the usages of war, it is necessary to define
the conception of espionage and of spies as precisely
as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_72">What is a
Spy?</div>

<p>A spy was defined by the German army staff in
1870 as one “who seeks to discover by clandestine
methods, in order to favor the enemy, the position of
troops, camps, etc.; on the other hand enemies who
are soldiers are only to be regarded as spies if they
have violated the rules of military usages, by denial
or concealment of their military character.”</p>

<p>The Brussels Declaration of 1874 defines the conception
as follows: “By a spy is to be understood
he who clandestinely or by illicit pretenses enters or
attempts to enter into places in the possession of the
enemy with the intention of obtaining information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
to be brought to the knowledge of the other side.”
The Hague Conference puts it in the same way.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_73">Of the
essentials of
Espionage.</div>

<p>The emphasis in both declarations is to be laid on
the idea of “secrecy” or “deception.” If regular
combatants make enquiries in this fashion, for example
in disguise, then they also come under the
category of spies, and can lawfully be treated as
such. Whether the espionage was successful or not
makes no difference. The motive which has
prompted the spy to accept his commission, whether
noble or ignoble, is, as we have already said, indifferent;
likewise, whether he has acted on his own
impulse or under a commission from his own State
or army. The military jurisdiction in this matter
cuts across the territorial principle and that of allegiance,
in that it makes no difference whether the spy
is the subject of the belligerent country or of another
State.</p>

<p>It is desirable that the heavy penalty which the
spy incurs should be the subject not of mere suspicion
but of actual proof of existence of the offense, by
means of a trial, however summary (if the swift
course of the war permits), and therefore the death
penalty will not be enforced without being preceded
by a judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_74">Accessories
are
Principals.</div>

<p>Participation in espionage, favoring it, harboring
a spy, are equally punishable with espionage itself.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_75">The Deserter
is faithless
and the
Renegade
false.</div>

<p>The difference between these two is this&mdash;the first
class are untrue to the colors, their intention being to
withdraw altogether from the conflict, to leave the
seat of war, and, it may be, to escape into a country
outside it; but the second class go over to the enemy
in order to fight in his ranks against their former
comrades. According to the general usages of war,
deserters and renegades, if they are caught, are to
be subjected to martial law and may be punished
with death.</p>

<p>Although some exponents of the laws of war claim
that deserters and renegades should be handed back
to one’s opponent, and on the other hand exactly the
opposite is insisted on by others, namely, the obligation
to accept them&mdash;all we can say is that a soldier
cannot admit any such obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_76">But both
may be

<p>Deserters and renegades weaken the power of the
enemy, and therefore to hand them over is not in the

to accept them or reject them, that is a matter for
one’s own decision.</p>

<span class="subhead">CIVILIANS IN THE TRAIN OF AN ARMY</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_77">“Followers.”</div>

<p>In the train of an army it is usual to find, temporarily
or permanently, a mass of civilians who are
indispensable to the satisfaction of the wants of
officers and soldiers or to the connection of the army
with the native population. To this category belong
all kinds of contractors, carriers of charitable gifts,
artists, and the like, and, above all, newspaper correspondents
whether native or foreign. If they fall
into the hands of the enemy, they have the right,
should their detention appear desirable, to be treated
as prisoners of war, assuming that they are in possession
of an adequate authorization.</p>

<p>For all these individuals, therefore, the possession
of a pass issued by the military authorities concerned,
in accordance with the forms required by international
intercourse, is an indispensable necessity, in
order that in the case of a brush with the enemy, or
of their being taken captive they may be recognized
as occupying a passive position and may not be
treated as spies.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
In the grant of these authorizations the utmost
circumspection should be shown by the military authorities;
this privilege should only be extended to
those whose position, character, and intentions are
fully known, or for whom trustworthy persons will
act as sureties.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_78">The War
Correspondent:
his importance.
His presence
is desirable.</div>

<p>This circumspection must be observed most scrupulously
in the case of newspaper correspondents
whether native or foreign. Since the component
parts of a modern army are drawn from all grades
of the population, the intervention of the Press for
the purpose of intellectual intercourse between the
army and the population at home can no longer be
dispensed with. The army also derives great advantages
from this intellectual intercourse; it has
had to thank the stimulus of the Press in recent campaigns
for an unbroken chain of benefits, quite apart
from the fact that news of the war in the newspapers
is a necessity for every soldier. The importance of
this intervention, and on the other hand the dangers
and disadvantages which may arise from its misuse,
make it obviously necessary that the military authorities
should control the whole of the Press when in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the field. In what follows we shall briefly indicate
the chief rules which are customary, in the modern
usages of war, as regards giving permission to newspaper
correspondents.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_79">The ideal
War Correspondent.</div>

<p>The first thing necessary in a war correspondent
is a sense of honor; in other words, he must be trustworthy.
Only a man who is known to be absolutely
trustworthy, or who can produce a most precise official
certificate or references from unimpeachable
persons, can be granted permission to attach himself
to headquarters.</p>

<p>An honorable correspondent will be anxious to
adhere closely to the duties he owes to his paper on
the one hand, and the demands of the army whose
hospitality he enjoys on the other. To do both is
not always easy, and in many cases tact and refinement
on the part of the correspondent can alone indicate
the right course; a censorship is proved by
experience to be of little use; the certificates and
recommendations required must therefore be explicit
as to the possession of these qualities by the applicant;
and according as he possesses them or not his
personal position at headquarters and the degree of
support extended to him in the discharge of his duties
will be decided.</p>

<p>It is therefore undoubtedly in the interest of the
army as of the Press, that the latter shall only despatch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
such representatives as really are equal to the
high demands which the profession of correspondent
requires.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_80">The Etiquette
of the War
Correspondent.</div>

<p>The correspondent admitted on the strength of
satisfactory pledges has therefore to promise on his
word of honor to abide by the following obligations:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. To spread no news as to the disposition, numbers,
or movements of troops, and, moreover, the intentions
and plans of the staff, unless he has
permission to publish them. (This concerns
principally correspondents of foreign newspapers
since one’s own newspapers are already subject to
a prohibition of this kind by the Imperial Press

</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_81">How to tell

<p>Those persons and objects who in war are to be
treated as inviolable must be recognizable by some
external mark. Such is the so-called Geneva Cross
(a red cross on a white ground) introduced by international
agreement.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>Attention is to be attracted in the case of persons
by armlets, in the case of buildings by flags, in the
case of wagons and other objects by a corresponding
paint mark.</p>

<p>If the mark is to receive adequate respect it is
essential:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. That it should be clearly visible and recognizable.</p>

<p>2. That it should only be worn by such persons or
attached to such objects as can lawfully claim it.</p></blockquote>

<p>As to 1. Banners and flags must be sufficiently
large to be both distinguishable and recognizable at
a far distance; they are to be so attached that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
will not be masked by any national flag that may be
near them, otherwise unintentional violations will
be unavoidable.</p>

<p>As to 2. Abuse will result in the protective mark
being no longer respected, and a further result would
be to render illusory, and to endanger, the whole of
the Geneva Convention. Measures must therefore
be taken to prevent such abuses and to require every

who wears these marks without being entitled to do
so.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<span class="subhead">WAR TREATIES</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_82">That Faith
must be kept
even with an
Enemy.</div>

<p>In the following pages we have only to do with war
treaties in the narrower sense, that is such as are
concluded during the war itself and have as their
object either the regulation of certain relations during
the period of the war, or only an isolated and
temporary measure. It is a principle of all such
treaties that: Etiam hosti fides servanda. Every
agreement is to be strictly observed by both sides in
the spirit and in the letter. Should this rule not
be observed by one side then the other has the right
to regard the treaty as denounced.</p>

<p>How a treaty is to be concluded depends on the
discretion of those who conclude it. Drafts or
models of treaties do not exist.</p>

<p class="p1 in0" id="h_135a"><span class="smcap smaller">A.</span>&mdash;<i>Treaties of Exchange</i></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_83">Exchange of
Prisoners.</div>

<p>These have for their object the mutual discharge
or exchange of prisoners of war. Whether the opponent
will agree to an offer of this kind or not, depends
entirely upon himself.</p>

<p>The usual stipulation is: An equal number on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
both sides. That is only another way of saying that
a surplus of prisoners on the one side need not be
handed over.</p>

<p>The restitution of a greater number of common
soldiers against officers can be stipulated; in that
case, the relative value of different grades must be
precisely fixed in the treaty.</p>

<p class="p1 in0" id="h_136"><span class="smcap smaller">B.</span>&mdash;<i>Treaties of Capitulation</i></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_84">Capitulations&mdash;they
cannot be too
meticulous.</div>

<p>The object of these is the surrender of fortresses or
strong places as also of troops in the open field.
Here again there can be no talk of a generally accepted
model. The usages of war have, however,
displayed some rules for capitulations, the observance
of which is to be recommended:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. Before any capitulation is concluded, the authority
of the Commander who concludes it should be
formally and unequivocally authenticated. How
necessary a precaution of this kind is, is shown
by the capitulations of Rapp at Danzig, and of
Gouvion St. Cyr at Dresden, in 1813, which were
actually annulled by the refusal of the General
Staff of the Allies to ratify them. At the trial
of Bazaine the indictment by General Rivière
denied the title of the Marshal to conclude a
capitulation.</p>

<p>2. If one of the parties to the treaty makes it a condition
that the confirmation of the monarch, or
the Commander-in-Chief, or even the national
assembly is to be obtained, then this circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
must be made quite clear. Also care is to be
taken that in the event of ratification being refused
every advantage that might arise from an
ambiguous proceeding on the part of one opponent,
be made impossible.</p>

<p>3. The chief effect of a capitulation is to prevent that
portion of the enemy’s force which capitulates
from taking any part in the conflict during the
rest of the war, or it may be for a fixed period.
The fate of the capitulating troops or of the surrendered
fortress differs in different cases.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the Treaty of Capitulation every condition
agreed upon both as to time and manner must
be expressed in precise and unequivocable words.
Conditions which violate the military honor of
those capitulated are not permissible according
to modern views. Also, if the capitulation is an
unconditional one or, to use the old formula, is
“at discretion,” the victor does not thereby, according
to the modern laws of war, acquire a
right of life and death over the persons capitulating.</p>

<p>4. Obligations which are contrary to the laws of nations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
such as, for example, to fight against
one’s own Fatherland during the continuation
of the war, cannot be imposed upon the troops
capitulating. Likewise, also, obligations such
as are forbidden them by their own civil or
military laws or terms of service, cannot be imposed.</p>

<p>5. Since capitulations are treaties of war they cannot
contain, for those contracting them, either rights
or duties which extend beyond the period of the
war, nor can they include dispositions as to matters
of constitutional law such as, for example, a
cession of territory.</p>

<p>6. A violation of any of the obligations of the treaty
of capitulation justifies an opponent in immediately
renewing hostilities without further ceremony.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_85">Of the White
Flag.</div>

<p>The external indication of a desire to capitulate is
the raising of a white flag. There exists no obligation
to cease firing immediately on the appearance
of this sign (or to cease hostilities). The attainment
of a particular important, possibly decisive,
point, the utilization of a favorable moment, the
suspicion of an illicit purpose in raising the white
flag, the saving of time, and the like, may induce the
commanding officer to disregard the sign until these
reasons have disappeared.</p>

<p>If, however, no such considerations exist, then
humanity imposes an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 in0" id="h_140"><span class="smcap smaller">C</span>.&mdash;<i>Safe-conducts</i></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_86">Of Safe-Conducts.</div>

<p>The object of these is to secure persons or things
from hostile treatment. The usages of war in this
matter furnish the following rules:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. Letters of safe-conduct, for persons, can only be
given to such persons as are certain to behave
peaceably and not to misuse them for hostile
purposes; letters of safe-conduct for things are
only to be granted under a guarantee of their not
being employed for warlike purposes.</p>

<p>2. The safe-conducts granted to persons are personal
to them, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, they are not available for others.
They do not extend to their companions unless
they are expressly mentioned.</p>

<p>An exception is only to be made in the case of
diplomatists of neutral States, in whose case their
usual entourage is assumed to be included even
though the members are not specifically named.</p>

<p>3. The safe-conduct is revocable at any time; it can
even be altogether withdrawn or not recognized
by another superior, if the military situation has
so altered that its use is attended with unfavorable
consequences for the party which has
granted it.</p>

<p>4. A safe-conduct for things on the other hand is not
confined to the person of the bearer. It is obvious
that if the person of the bearer appears at
all suspicious, the safe-conduct can be withdrawn.
This can also happen in the case of an
officer who does not belong to the authority which
granted it. The officer concerned is in this case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
fully responsible for his proceedings, and should
report accordingly.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="h_141"><span class="smcap smaller">D.</span>&mdash;<i>Treaties of Armistice</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_87">Of Armistices.</div>

<p>By armistice is understood a temporary cessation
of hostilities by agreement. It rests upon the voluntary
agreement of both parties. The object is either
the satisfaction of a temporary need such as carrying
away the dead, collecting the wounded, and the like,
or the preparation of a surrender or of negotiations
for peace.</p>

<p>A general armistice must accordingly be distinguished
from a local or particular one. The general
armistice extends to the whole seat of war, to
the whole army, and to allies; it is therefore a
formal cessation of the war. A particular armistice
on the contrary relates only to a part of the seat of
war, to a single part of the opposing army. Thus
the armistice of Poischwitz in the autumn of 1813
was a general armistice; that of January 28th, 1871,
between Germany and France, was a particular or
local one, since the South-Eastern part of the theater
of war was not involved.</p>

<p>The right to conclude an armistice, whether general
or particular, belongs only to a person in high
command, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, the Commander-in-Chief. Time to
go and obtain the consent of the ruling powers may
be wanting. However, if the object of the armistice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
is to begin negotiations for peace, it is obvious that
this can only be determined by the highest authorities
of the State.</p>

<p>If an agreement is concluded, then both sides must
observe its provisions strictly in the letter and the
spirit. A breach of the obligations entered into on
the one side can only lead to the immediate renewal
of hostilities on the other side.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> A notification is in
this case only necessary if the circumstances admit
of the consequent loss of time. If the breach of
the armistice is the fault of individuals, then the
party to whom they belong is not immediately responsible
and cannot be regarded as having broken
faith. If, therefore, the behavior of these individuals
is not favored or approved by their superiors,
there is no ground for a resumption of hostilities.
But the guilty persons ought, in such case, to be punished
by the party concerned.</p>

<p>Even though the other party does not approve the
behavior of the trespassers but is powerless to prevent
such trespasses, then the opponent is justified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
in regarding the armistice as at an end. In order
to prevent unintentional violation both parties should
notify the armistice as quickly as possible to all, or
at any rate to the divisions concerned. Delay in the
announcement of the armistice through negligence
or bad faith lies, of course, at the door of him whose
duty it was to announce it. A violation due to the
bad faith of an individual is to be sternly punished.</p>

<p>No one can be compelled to give credit to a communication
from the enemy to the effect that an
armistice has been concluded; the teaching of military
history is full of warnings against lightly
crediting such communications.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>A fixed form for the conclusion of an armistice is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
not prescribed. A definite and clear declaration is
sufficient. It is usual and is advisable to have
treaties of this kind in writing in order to exclude
all complication, and, in the case of differences of
opinion later on, to have a firm foundation to go
upon.</p>

<p>During the armistice nothing must occur which
could be construed as a continuation of hostilities,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i> must rather be observed as far as
possible, provided that the wording of the treaty does
not particularize anything to the contrary. On the
other hand the belligerents are permitted to do everything
which betters or strengthens their position after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the expiry of the armistice and the continuation of
hostilities. Thus, for example, troops may unhesitatingly
be exercised, fresh ones recruited, arms and
munitions manufactured, and food supplies brought
up, troops shifted and reenforcements brought on the
scene. Whether destroyed or damaged fortifications
may also be restored is a question to which different
answers are given by influential teachers of the law
of nations. It is best settled by express agreement in
concrete cases, and so with the revictualing of a besieged
fortress.</p>

<p>As regards its duration, an armistice can be concluded
either for a determined or an undetermined
period, and with or without a time for giving notice.
If no fixed period is agreed upon, then hostilities can
be recommenced at any time. This, however, is to
be made known to the enemy punctually, so that the
resumption does not represent a surprise. If a fixed
time is agreed on, then hostilities can be recommenced
the very moment it expires, and without any
previous notification. The commencement of an
armistice is, in the absence of an express agreement
fixing another time, to date from the moment of its
conclusion; the armistice expires at dawn of the day
to which it extends. Thus an armistice made to
last until January 1st comes to an end on the last
hour of December 31st, and a shorter armistice with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the conclusion of the number of hours agreed upon;
thus, for example, an armistice concluded on May
1st at 6 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> for 48 hours last until May 3rd at
6 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span></span></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_88">The Civil
Population
is not to be
regarded as
an enemy.</div>

<p>It has already been shown in the introduction that
war concerns not merely the active elements, but that
also the passive elements are involved in the common
suffering, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, the inhabitants of the occupied
territory who do not belong to the army. Opinions as
to the relations between these peaceable inhabitants
of the occupied territory and the army in hostile
possession have fundamentally altered in the course
of the last century. Whereas in earlier times the
devastation of the enemy’s territory, the destruction
of property, and, in some cases indeed, the carrying
away of the inhabitants into bondage or captivity,
were regarded as a quite natural consequence of the
state of war, and whereas in later times milder treatment
of the inhabitants took place although destruction
and annihilation as a military resource still continued
to be entertained, and the right of plundering
the private property of the inhabitants remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
completely unlimited&mdash;to-day, the universally prevalent
idea is that the inhabitants of the enemy’s
territory are no longer to be regarded, generally
speaking, as enemies. It will be admitted, as a matter
of law, that the population is, in the exceptional
circumstances of war, subjected to the limitations,
burdens, and measures of compulsion conditioned by
it, and owes obedience for the time being to the
power <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i>, but may continue to exist otherwise
undisturbed and protected as in time of peace by the
course of law.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_89">They must
not be
molested.</div>

<p>It follows from all this, as a matter of right, that,
as regards the personal position of the inhabitants of
the occupied territory, neither in life or in limb, in
honor or in freedom, are they to be injured, and that
every unlawful killing; every bodily injury, due to
fraud or negligence; every insult; every disturbance
of domestic peace; every attack on family, honor,
and morality and, generally, every unlawful and outrageous
attack or act of violence, are just as strictly
punishable as though they had been committed
against the inhabitants of one’s own land. There
follows, also, as a right of the inhabitants of the
enemy territory, that the invading army can only
limit their personal independence in so far as the
necessity of war unconditionally demands it, and that
any infliction that needlessly goes beyond this is to
be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_90">Their duty.</div>

<p>As against this right, there is naturally a corresponding
duty on the part of the inhabitants to conduct
themselves in a really peaceable manner, in no
wise to participate in the conflict, to abstain from
every injury to the troops of the power in occupation,
and not to refuse obedience to the enemy’s government.
If this presumption is not fulfilled, then
there can no longer be any talk of violations of
the immunities of the inhabitants, rather they are
treated and punished strictly according to martial
law.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_91">Of the humanity
of
the Germans
and the barbarity
of the
French.</div>

<p>The conception here put forward as to the relation
between the army and the inhabitants of an enemy’s
territory, corresponds to that of the German Staff
in the years 1870&ndash;71. It was given expression in
numerous proclamations, and in still more numerous
orders of the day, of the German Generals. In contrast
to this the behavior of the French authorities
more than once betrays a complete ignorance of the
elementary rules of the law of nations, alike in their
diplomatic accusations against the Germans and in
the words used towards their own subjects. Thus,
on the outbreak of the war, a threat was addressed
to the Grand Duchy of Baden, not only by the
French Press but also officially (von amtlicher
Stelle),<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> “that even its women would not be protected.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
So also horses of Prussian officers, who
had been shot by the peasants, were publicly put up
to auction by the murderers. So also the Franctireurs
threatened the inhabitants of villages occupied
by the Germans that they would be shot and their
houses burnt down if they received the enemy in their
houses or “were to enter into intercourse with them.”
So also the prefect of the Cote d’Or, in an official circular
of November 21st, urges the sub-prefects and
mayors of his Department to a systematic pursuit of
assassination, when he says: “The Fatherland
does not demand of you that you should assemble
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> and openly oppose the enemy, it only expects
that three or four determined men should leave
the village every morning and conceal themselves in
a place indicated by nature, from which, without
danger, they can shoot the Prussians; above all, they
are to shoot at the enemy’s mounted men whose
horses they are to deliver up at the principal place
of the Arrondissement. I will award a bonus to
them (for the delivery of such horses), and will publish
their heroic deed in all the newspapers of the
Department, as well as in the <cite>Moniteur</cite>.” But this
conception of the relation between the inhabitants
and the hostile army not only possessed the minds of
the provincial authorities but also the central government
at Tours itself, as is clear from the fact that
it held it necessary to stigmatize publicly the members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of the municipal commission at Soissons who,
after an attempt on the life of a Prussian sentry by
an unknown hand, prudently warned their members
against a repetition of such outrages, when it [the
central government] ordered “that the names of the
men who had lent themselves to the assistance and
interpretation of the enemy’s police be immediately
forthcoming.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> And if, on the French side, the
proclamation of General von Falckenstein is cited
as a proof of similar views on the German side&mdash;the
proclamation wherein the dwellers on the coast
of the North Sea and the Baltic are urged to participate
in the defense of the coast, and are told: “Let
every Frenchman who sets foot on your coast be
forfeit”&mdash;as against this all that need be said is that
this incitement, as is well known, had no effect in
Germany and excited the greatest surprise and was
properly condemned.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_92">What the
Invader may
do.</div>

<p>Having thus developed the principles governing
the relation between the hostile army and the inhabitants,
we will now consider somewhat more
closely the duties of the latter and the burdens which,
in a given case, it is allowable to impose upon it.
Obviously a precise enumeration of every kind of
service which may be demanded from them is impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
but the following of the most frequent occurrence
are:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. Restriction of post, railway and letter communication,
supervision, or, indeed, total prohibition of
the same.</p>

<p>2. Limitation of freedom of movement within the
country, prohibition to frequent certain parts of
the seat of war, or specified places.</p>

<p>3. Surrender of arms.</p>

<p>4. Obligation to billet the enemy’s soldiers; prohibition
of illumination of windows at night and the
like.</p>

<p>5. Production of conveyances.</p>

<p>6. Performance of work on streets, bridges, trenches
(<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gräben</i>), railways, buildings, etc.</p>

<p>7. Production of hostages.</p></blockquote>

<p>As to 1, the necessity of interrupting, in many
cases, railway, postal, and telegraph communication,
of stopping them or, at the least, stringently supervising
them, hardly calls for further proof. Human
feeling on the part of the commanding officer will
know what limits to fix, where the needs of the war
and the necessities of the population permit of mutual
accommodation.</p>

<p>As to 2, if according to modern views no inhabitant
of occupied territory can be compelled to
participate directly in the fight against his own
Fatherland, so, conversely, he can be prevented from
reenforcing his own army. Thus the German staff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
in 1870, where it had acquired authority, in particular
in Alsace-Lorraine, sought to prevent the entrance
of the inhabitants into the French army, even
as in the Napoleonic wars the French authorities
sought to prevent the adherence of the States of the
Rhine Confederation to the army of the Allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_93">A man may be
compelled
to betray his
Country.</div>

<p>The view that no inhabitant of occupied territory
can be compelled to participate directly in the struggle
against his own country is subject to an exception
by the general usages of war which must be recorded
here: the calling up and employment of the
inhabitants as guides on unfamiliar ground. However
much it may ruffle human feeling, to compel
a man to do harm to his own Fatherland, and indirectly
to fight his own troops, none the less no
army operating in an enemy’s country will altogether
renounce this expedient.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_94">And Worse.</div>

<p>But a still more severe measure is the compulsion
of the inhabitants to furnish information about their
own army, its strategy, its resources, and its military
secrets. The majority of writers of all nations are
unanimous in their condemnation of this measure.
Nevertheless it cannot be entirely dispensed with;
doubtless it will be applied with regret, but the argument
of war will frequently make it necessary.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_96">Of a certain
harsh measure
and its
justification.</div>

<p>As to 5 and 6, the summoning of the inhabitants
to supply vehicles and perform works has also been
stigmatized as an unjustifiable compulsion upon the
inhabitants to participate in “Military operations.”
But it is clear that an officer can never allow such a
far-reaching extension of this conception, since otherwise
every possibility of compelling work would disappear,
while every kind of work to be performed in
war, every vehicle to be furnished in any connection
with the conduct of war, is or may be bound up
with it. Thus the argument of war must decide.
The German Staff, in the War of 1870, moreover,
rarely made use of compulsion in order to obtain
civilian workers for the performance of necessary
works. It paid high wages and, therefore, almost always
had at its disposal sufficient offers. This procedure
should, therefore, be maintained in future
cases. The provision of a supply of labor is best
arranged through the medium of the local authorities.
In case of refusal of workers punishment can, of
course, be inflicted. Therefore the conduct of the
German civil commissioner, Count Renard&mdash;so
strongly condemned by French jurists and jurists
with French sympathies&mdash;who, in order to compel
labor for the necessary repair of a bridge, threatened,
in case of further refusal, after stringent threats of
punishment had not succeeded in getting the work
done, to punish the workers by shooting some of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
was in accordance with the actual laws of war; <em>the
main thing was that it attained its object</em>, without
its being necessary to practise it. The accusation
made by the French that, on the German side,
Frenchmen were compelled to labor at the siege
works before Strassburg, has been proved to be incorrect.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_97">Hostages.</div>

<p>7. By hostages are understood those persons who,
as security or bail for the fulfilment of treaties, promises
or other claims, are taken or detained by the
opposing State or its army. Their provision has
been less usual in recent wars, as a result of which
some Professors of the law of nations have wrongly
decided that the taking of hostages has disappeared
from the practise of civilized nations. As a matter
of fact it was frequently practised in the Napoleonic
wars; also in the wars of 1848, 1849, and 1859 by
the Austrians in Italy; in 1864 and 1866 by Prussia;
in the campaigns of the French in Algiers; of the
Russians in the Caucasus; of the English in their
Colonial wars, as being the usual thing. The unfavorable
criticisms of it by the German Staff in
isolated cases is therefore to be referred to different
grounds of applied expedients.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_98">A “harsh
and cruel”
measure.</div>

<p>A new application of “hostage-right” was practised
by the German Staff in the war of 1870, when
it compelled leading citizens from French towns and
villages to accompany trains and locomotives in order
to protect the railways communications which
were threatened by the people. Since the lives of
peaceable inhabitants were without any fault on their
part thereby exposed to grave danger, every writer
outside Germany has stigmatized this measure as
contrary to the law of nations and as unjustified towards
the inhabitants of the country. As against
this unfavorable criticism it must be pointed out that
this measure, which was also recognized on the German
side as harsh and cruel, was only resorted to
after declarations and instructions of the occupying<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
authorities had proved ineffective, and that in
the particular circumstance it was the only method
which promised to be effective against the doubtless
unauthorized, indeed the criminal, behavior of a
fanatical population.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_99">But it was
“successful.”</div>

<p>Herein lies its justification under the laws of war,
but still more in the fact that it proved completely
successful, and that wherever citizens were thus carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
on the trains (whether result was due to the increased
watchfulness of the communes or to the immediate
influence on the population), the security of
traffic was restored.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>To protect oneself against attack and injuries
from the inhabitants and to employ ruthlessly the
necessary means of defense and intimidation is obviously
not only a right but indeed a duty of the
staff of the army. The ordinary law will in this matter
generally not suffice, it must be supplemented
by the law of the enemy’s might. Martial law and
courts-martial must take the place of the ordinary
jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>To Martial law are subject in particular:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. All attacks, violations, homicides, and robberies, by
soldiers belonging to the army of occupation.</p>

<p>2. All attacks on the equipment of this army, its supplies,
ammunition, and the like.</p>

<p>3. Every destruction of communication, such as
bridges, canals, roads, railways and telegraphs.</p>

<p>4. War rebellion and war treason.</p></blockquote>

<p>Only the fourth point requires explanation.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_100">War Rebellion.</div>

<p>By war rebellion is to be understood the taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
up of arms by the inhabitants against the occupation;
by war treason on the other hand the injury or imperiling
of the enemy’s authority through deceit or
through communication of news to one’s own army
as to the disposition, movement, and intention, etc.,
of the army in occupation, whether the person concerned
has come into possession of his information
by lawful or unlawful means (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, by espionage).</p>

<p>Against both of these only the most ruthless measures
are effective. Napoleon wrote to his brother
Joseph, when, after the latter ascended the throne of
Naples, the inhabitants of lower Italy made various
attempts at revolt: “The security of your dominion
depends on how you behave in the conquered
province. Burn down a dozen places which are not
willing to submit themselves. Of course, not until
you have first looted them; my soldiers must not be
allowed to go away with their hands empty. Have
three to six persons hanged in every village which
has joined the revolt; pay no respect to the cassock.
Simply bear in mind how I dealt with them in
Piacenza and Corsica.” The Duke of Wellington, in
1814, threatened the South of France; “he will, if
leaders of factions are supported, burn the villages
and have their inhabitants hanged.” In the year
1815, he issued the following proclamation: “All
those who after the entry of the (English) army into
France leave their dwellings and all those who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
found in the service of the usurper will be regarded
as adherents of his and as enemies; their property
will be used for the maintenance of the army.”
“These are the expressions in the one case of one of
the great masters of war and of the dominion founded
upon war power, and in the other, of a commander-in-chief
who elsewhere had carried the protection of
private property in hostile lands to the extremest
possible limit. Both men as soon as a popular rising
takes place resort to terrorism.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_101">“War Treason”
and
Unwilling
Guides.</div>

<p>A particular kind of war treason, which must be
briefly gone into here, inasmuch as the views of the
jurists about it differ very strongly from the usages
of war, is the case of deception in leading the way,
perpetrated in the form of deliberate guiding of the
enemy’s troops by an inhabitant on a false or disadvantageous
road. If he has offered his services,
then the fact of his treason is quite clear, but also in
case he was forced to act as guide his offense cannot
be judged differently, for he owed obedience to the
power in occupation, he durst in no case perpetrate
an act of open resistance and positive harm but
should have, if the worst came to the worst, limited
himself to passive disobedience, and he must therefore
bear the consequence.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_102">Another
deplorable
necessity.</div>

<p>However intelligible the inclination to treat and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to judge an offense of this kind from a milder standpoint
may appear, none the less the leader of the
troops thus harmed cannot do otherwise than punish
the offender with death, since only by harsh measures
of defense and intimidation can the repetition of
such offenses be prevented. In this case a court-martial
must precede the infliction of the penalty.
The court-martial must however be on its guard
against imputing hastily a treasonable intent to the
guide. The punishment of misdirection requires in
every case proof of evil intention.</p>

<p>Also it is not allowable to diplomatic agents to
make communications from the country which they
inhabit during the war to any side as to the military
situation or proceedings. Persons contravening this
universally recognized usage of war may be immediately
expelled or in the case of great danger arrested.</p>

<span class="subhead">PRIVATE PROPERTY IN WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_103">Of Private
Property and
its immunities.</div>

<p>Since, according to the law of nations and the law
of war to-day, war makes enemies of States and not
of private persons, it follows that every arbitrary
devastation of the country and every destruction of
private property, generally speaking every unnecessary
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, not required by the necessity of war) injury
to alien property is contrary to the law of nations.
Every inhabitant of the territory occupied is
therefore to be protected alike in his person and in
his property.</p>

<p>In this sense spoke King William to the French at
the beginning of the Campaign of 1870: “I wage
war with the French soldiers and not with the
French citizens. The latter will therefore continue
to enjoy security for their person and their goods,
so long as they do not by hostile undertakings against
German troops deprive me of the right to afford them
my protection.”</p>

<p>The question stands in quite another position if
the necessity of war demands the requisition of the
stranger’s property, whether public or private. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
this case of course every sequestration, every temporary
or permanent deprivation, every use, every injury
and all destruction are permitted.</p>

<p>The following principles therefore result:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. Prohibited unconditionally are all aimless destructions,
devastations, burnings, and ravages of the
enemy’s country. The soldier who practises such
things is punished as an offender according to
the appropriate laws.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>2. Permissible on the other hand are all destructions
and injuries dictated by military considerations;
and, indeed,</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>(<i>a</i>) All demolitions of houses and other buildings,
bridges, railways, and telegraphic
establishments, due to the necessity of military
operations.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) All injuries which are required through
military movements in the country or for
earthworks for attack or defense.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence the double rule: No harm must be done,
not even the very slightest, which is not dictated by
military consideration; every kind of harm may be
done, even the very utmost, which the conduct of war
requires or which comes in the natural course of it.</p>

<p>Whether the natural justification exists or not is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
a subject for decision in each individual case. The
answer to this question lies entirely in the power of
the Commanding Officer, from whose conscience our
times can expect and demand as far-reaching humanity
as the object of war permits.</p>

<p>On similar principles must be answered the question
as to the temporary use of property, dispositions
as to houses and the like: no inhabitant of the occupied
territory is to be disturbed in the use and
free disposition of his property, on the other hand
the necessity of war justifies the most far-reaching
disturbance, restriction, and even imperiling of his
property. In consequence there are permitted:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. Requisitions of houses and their furniture for the
purpose of billeting troops.</p>

<p>2. Use of houses and their furniture for the care of
the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>3. Use of buildings for observation, shelter, defense,
fortification, and the like.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether the property owners are subjects of the
occupied territory or of a Foreign State is a matter
of complete indifference; also the property of the
Sovereign and his family is subject to no exception,
although to-day it is usually treated with courtesy.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_104">Of German
behavior.</div>

<p>The conception of the inviolability of private property
here depicted was shared by the Germans in
1870 and was observed. If on the French side statements
to the contrary are even to-day given expression,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
they rest either on untruth or exaggeration.
It certainly cannot be maintained that no illegitimate
violations of private property by individuals ever
occurred. But that kind of thing can never be entirely
avoided even among the most highly cultivated
nations, and the best disciplined armies. In every
case the strictest respect for private property was enjoined<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
upon the soldiers by the German Military
Authorities after crossing the frontier, and strong
measures were taken in order to make this injunction
effective; the property of the French was indeed,
as might be shown in numerous cases, protected
against the population itself, and was even
in several cases saved at the risk of our own
lives.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_105">The gentle
Hun and the
looking-glass.</div>

<p>In like manner arbitrary destructions and ravages
of buildings and the like did not occur on the German
side where they were not called forth by the
behavior of the inhabitants themselves. They
scarcely ever occurred except where the inhabitants
had foolishly left their dwellings and the soldiers
were excited by closed doors and want of food. “If
the soldier finds the doors of his quarters shut, and
the food intentionally concealed or buried, then necessity
impels him to burst open the doors and to track
the stores, and he then, in righteous anger, destroys
a mirror, and with the broken furniture heats the
stove.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>If minor injuries explain themselves in this
fashion in the eyes of every reasonable and thinking
man, so the result of a fundamental and unprejudiced
examination has shown that the destructions and
ravages on a greater scale, which were made a reproach
against the German Army, have in no case
overstepped the necessity prescribed by the military
situation. Thus the much talked of and, on the
French side, enormously exaggerated, burning down
of twelve houses in Bazeilles, together with the shooting
of an inhabitant, were completely justified and,
indeed, in harmony with the laws of war; indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
one may maintain that the conduct of the inhabitants
would have called for the complete destruction of
the village and the condemnation of all the adult inhabitants
by martial law.</p>

<span class="subhead">BOOTY AND PLUNDERING</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_106">Booty.</div>

<p>In section 1, the inhabitant of the enemy’s territory
was described as a subject of legal rights and duties,
who, so far as the nature of war allows, may
continue to live protected as in time of peace by the
course of law; further, in section 2, property,
whether it be public or private, was likewise, so far
as war allows it, declared to be inviolable&mdash;it therefore
follows logically that there can exist no right to
the appropriation of the property, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, a right to
booty or plundering. Opinions as to this have, in
the course of the last century, undergone a complete
change; the earlier unlimited right of appropriation
in war is to-day recognized in regard to public property
as existing only in defined circumstances.</p>

<p>In the development of the principles recognized
to-day we have to distinguish.</p>

<p>1. State property and unquestionably:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) immovable,<a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) movable.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
2. Private property:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) immovable,</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) movable.</p></blockquote>

<p>Immovable State property is now no longer forfeited
as booty; it may, however, be used if such use
is in the interests of military operation, and even
destroyed, or temporarily administered. While in
the wars of the First French Empire, Napoleon, in
numerous cases, even during the war itself, disposed
of the public property of the enemy (domains, castles,
mines, salt-works) in favor of his Marshals and
diplomatists, to-day an appropriation of this kind is
considered by international opinion to be unjustified
and, in order to be valid, requires a formal treaty
between the conqueror and the conquered.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_107">The State
realty may
be used but
must not be
wasted.</div>

<p>The Military Government by the army of occupation
is only a Usufructuary <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro tempore</i>. It must,
therefore, avoid every purposeless injury, it has no
right to sell or dispose of the property. According
to this juristic view the military administration of
the conqueror disposes of the public revenue and
taxes which are raised in the occupied territory, with
the understanding, however, that the regular and unavoidable
expenses of administration continue to be
defrayed. The military authority controls the railways
and telegraphs of the enemy’s State, but here
also it possesses only the right of use and has to give
back the material after the end of the war. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
administration of the State forests, it is not bound
to follow the mode of administration of the enemy’s
Forest authorities, but it must not damage the woods
by excessive cutting, still less may it cut them down
altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_108">State Personalty
is at
the mercy of
the victor.</div>

<p>Movable State property on the other hand can, according
to modern views, be unconditionally appropriated
by the conqueror.</p>

<p>This includes public funds,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> arms, and munition
stores, magazines, transport, material supplies useful
for the war and the like. Since the possession of
things of this kind is of the highest importance for
the conduct of the war, the conqueror is justified in
destroying and annihilating them if he is not able to
keep them.</p>

<p>On the other hand an exception is made as to all
objects which serve the purposes of religious worship,
education, the sciences and arts, charities and nursing.
Protection must therefore be extended to: the
property of churches and schools, of libraries and
museums, of almshouses and hospitals. The usual
practise of the Napoleonic campaigns<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> so ruthlessly
resorted to of carrying off art treasures, antiquities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and whole collections, in order to incorporate them
in one’s own art galleries, is no longer allowed by the
law of nations to-day.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_109">Private
realty.</div>

<p>Immovable private property may well be the object
of military operations and military policy, but
cannot be appropriated as booty, nor expended for
fiscal or private purposes of acquisition. This also
includes, of course, the private property of the ruling
family, in so far as it really possesses this character
and is not Crown Lands, whose fruits are expended
as a kind of Civil List or serve to supplement the
same.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_110">Private
personalty.</div>

<p>Movable private property, finally, which in earlier
times was the undeniable booty of the conqueror, is
to-day regarded as inviolable. The carrying off of
money, watches, rings, trinkets, or other objects of
value, is therefore to be regarded as criminal robbery
and to be punished accordingly.</p>

<p>The appropriation of private property is regarded
as partially permissible in the case of those objects
which the conquered combatant carries on his own
person. Still here also, opinions against the practise
make it clear that the taking away of objects of value,
money, and such-like is not permissible, and only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
those required for the equipment of troops are declared
capable of appropriation.</p>

<p>The recognition of the inviolability of private
property does not of course exclude the sequestration
of such objects as can, although they are private
property, at the same time be regarded as of use in
war. This includes, for example, warehouses of supplies,
stores of arms in factories, depots of conveyances
or other means of traffic, as bicycles, motor
cars, and the like, or other articles likely to be of use
with advantage to the army, as telescopes, etc. In
order to assure to the possessors compensation from
their government, equity enjoins that a receipt be
given for the sequestration.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_111">“Choses in
action.”</div>

<p>Logically related to movable property are the so-called
“incorporeal things.” When Napoleon, for
example, appropriated the debts due to the Elector
of Hesse and thus compelled the Elector’s debtors to
pay their debts to him; when he furthermore in 1807
allowed the debts owed by the inhabitants of the
Duchy of Warsaw to Prussian banks and other public
institutions, and indeed even to private persons in
Prussia, to be assigned by the King of Prussia, and
then sold them to the King of Saxony for 200 million
francs, this was, according to the modern view, nothing
better than robbery.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_112">Plundering
is wicked.</div>

<p>Plundering is to be regarded as the worst form of
appropriation of a stranger’s property. By this is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to be understood the robbing of inhabitants by the
employment of terror and the abuse of a military
superiority. The main point of the offense thus consists
in the fact that the perpetrator, finding himself
in the presence of the browbeaten owner, who feels
defenseless and can offer no opposition, appropriates
things, such as food and clothing, which he does not
want for his own needs. It is not plundering but
downright burglary if a man pilfers things out of
uninhabited houses or at times when the owner is
absent.</p>

<p>Plundering is by the law of nations to-day to be regarded
as invariably unlawful. If it may be difficult
sometimes in the very heat of the fight to restrain
excited troops from trespasses, yet unlawful plundering,
extortion, or other violations of property,
must be most sternly punished, it matters not whether
it be done by members of unbroken divisions of
troops or by detached soldiers, so-called marauders,
or by the “hyenas of the battlefield.” To permit
such transgressions only leads, as experience shows,
to bad discipline and the demoralization of the
Army.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
In the Franco-Prussian War, plundering and taking
of booty were on the German side sternly forbidden.
The Articles of War in question were repeatedly
recalled to every soldier just as in time of
peace, also numerous orders of the day were issued
on the part of the higher authorities. Transgressions
were ruthlessly punished, in some cases even
after the War.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_113">Requisitions.</div>

<p>By requisitions is to be understood the compulsory
appropriation of certain objects necessary for the
army which is waging war. What things belong to
this category is quite undetermined. They were
primarily the means to feed man and beast, next to
clothe and equip the members of the army, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, to
substitute clothing and equipment for that which has
worn out or become insufficient in view of the altered
circumstances and also to supplement it; furthermore,
there will be such objects as serve for the transport
of necessaries, and finally all objects may be demanded
which serve to supply a temporary necessity,
such as material and tools for the building of fortifications,
bridges, railways and the like. That requisitions
of this kind are unconditionally necessary
and indispensable for the existence of the army, no
one has yet denied; and whether one bases it legally
upon necessity or merely upon the might of the
stronger is a matter of indifference as far as the practise
is concerned.</p>

way.”</div>

<p>The right generally recognized by the law of nations
of to-day to requisition is a child of the French
Revolution and its wars. It is known that as late as
in the year 1806, Prussian battalions camped close
to big stacks of corn and bivouacked on potato fields
without daring to appease their hunger with the property
of the stranger; the behavior of the French
soon taught them a better way. Every one knows the
ruthless fashion in which the army of the French
Republic and of Napoleon satisfied their wants, but
of late opinion laying stress upon the protection of
private property has asserted itself. Since a prohibition
of requisitions would, considering what war is,
have no prospect of acceptance under the law of nations,
the demand has been put forward that the
objects supplied should at least be paid for. This
idea has indeed up till now not become a principle
of war, the right of requisitioning without payment
exists as much as ever and will certainly be claimed
in the future by the armies in the field, and also,
considering the size of modern armies, must be
claimed; but it has at least become the custom to
requisition with as much forbearance as possible, and
to furnish a receipt for what is taken, the discharge
of which is then determined on the conclusion of
peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_115">To exhaust
the country
is deplorable
but we mean
to do it.</div>

<p>In order to avoid overdoing it, as may easily happen
in the case of requisitions, it is often arranged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
that requisitions may never be demanded by subordinates
but only by the higher officers, and that
the local civil authorities shall be employed for the
purpose. It cannot, however, be denied that this is
not always possible in war; that on the contrary the
leader of a small detachment and in some circumstances
even a man by himself may be under the necessity
to requisition what is indispensable to him.
Article 40 of the Declaration of Brussels requires
that the requisitions (being written out) shall bear
a direct relation to the capacity and resources of
a country, and, indeed, the justification for this condition
would be willingly recognized by every one in
theory, but it will scarcely ever be observed in practise.
In cases of necessity the needs of the army will
alone decide, and a man does well generally to make
himself familiar with the reflection that, in the changing
and stormy course of a war, observance of the
orderly conduct of peaceful times is, with the best
will, impossible.</p>

<p>In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870: much was
requisitioned on the German side. According to the
opinion of all impartial writers it was done with moderation
and the utmost tenderness for the inhabitants,
even if in isolated cases excesses occurred. Receipts
were always furnished. Later, in the case of
the army on the Meuse, as early as the middle of
October requisitions were, wherever it was possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
entirely left out of account and everything was paid
for in cash. Later proceedings were frequently and
indeed studiously conducted with a precise estimate
of the value in thalers or francs.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> “Moreover, military
history knows of no campaign in which the victualing
of an army at such a distance from home was
so largely conducted with its own stores.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_116">“Buccaneering
Levies.”</div>

<p>By war levies or contributions is to be understood
the raising of larger or smaller sums of money from
the parishes of the occupied territory. They are thus
to be distinguished from requisitions since they do not
serve for the satisfaction of a momentary want of the
army and consequently can only in the rarest cases
be based upon the necessity of war. These levies
originated as so-called “Brandschatzungen,” <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, as
a ransom from plundering and devastation, and thus
constituted, compared with the earlier looting system,
a step in the humanizing of war. Since the
law of nations to-day no longer recognizes any right
to plundering and devastation, and inasmuch as the
principle that war is conducted only against States,
and not against private persons, is uncontested, it
follows logically that levies which can be characterized
as simply booty-making or plundering, that is to
say, as arbitrary enrichment of the conquerors, are
not permitted by modern opinion. The conqueror is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
in particular, not justified in recouping himself for
the cost of the war by inroads upon the property of
private persons, even though the war was forced upon
him.</p>

<p>War levies are therefore only allowed:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. As a substitute for taxes.</p>

<p>2. As a substitute for the supplies to be furnished as
requisitions by the population.</p>

<p>3. As punishments.</p></blockquote>

<p>As to 1: This rests upon the right of the power
in occupation to raise and utilize taxes.</p>

<p>As to 2: In cases where the provision of prescribed
objects in a particular district is impossible,
and in consequence the deficiency has to be met by
purchase in a neighboring district.</p>

<p>As to 3: War levies as a means of punishing individuals
or whole parishes were very frequently employed
in the Franco-Prussian War. If French
writers accuse the German staff of excessive severity
in this respect, on the other hand it is to be remarked
that the embittered character which the war
took on in its latest stage, and the lively participation
of the population therein, necessitated the sternest
measures. But a money tax, judging by experience,
operates, in most cases, on the civil population. The
total sum of all the money contributions raised in
the War of 1870 may be called a minimum compared
with the sums which Napoleon was accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
draw from the territories occupied by him. According
to official estimates, havoc amounting to about six
milliards of francs was visited upon the four million
inhabitants of Prussia in the years 1807&ndash;13.</p>

<p>In regard to the raising of war levies it should be
noted that they should only be decreed by superior
officers and only raised with the cooperation of the
local authorities. Obviously an acknowledgment of
every sum raised is to be furnished.</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. In the military laws of different countries the right
of levying contributions is exclusively reserved
to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>2. The usual method of raising taxes would, in consequence
of their slowness, not be in harmony
with the demands of the War; usually, therefore,
the Civil Authorities provide themselves with the
necessary money by a loan, the repayment of
which is provided for later by law.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">ADMINISTRATION OF OCCUPIED TERRITORY</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_117">How to
administer
an Invaded
Country.</div>

<p>According to earlier views right up to the last century,
a Government whose army had victoriously
forced itself into the territory of a foreign State
could do exactly as it pleased in the part occupied.
No regard was to be paid to the constitution, laws,
and rights of the inhabitants. Modern times have
now introduced, in this respect, a change in the dominant
conceptions, and have established a certain legal
relationship between the inhabitants and the army of
occupation. If, in the following pages, we develop
briefly the principles which are applied to the government
of territory in occupation, it must none the
less be clearly emphasized that the necessities of war
not only allow a deviation from these principles in
many cases but in some circumstances make it a
positive duty of the Commander.</p>

<p>The occupation of a portion of the enemy’s territory
does not amount to an annexation of it. The
right of the original State authority consequently remains
in existence; it is only suspended when it
comes into collision with the stronger power of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
conqueror during the term of the occupation, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>,
only for the time being.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>But the administration of a country itself cannot
be interrupted by war; it is therefore in the interest
of the country and its inhabitants themselves, if the
conqueror takes it in hand, to let it be carried on
either with the help of the old, or, if this is not
feasible, through the substitution of the new, authorities.</p>

<p>From this fundamental conception now arises a
series of rights and duties of the conqueror on the
one side and of the inhabitants on the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_118">The Laws
remain&mdash;with
qualification.</div>

<p>Since the conqueror is only the substitute for the
real Government, he will have to establish the continuation
of the administration of the country with
the help of the existing laws and regulations. The
issue of new laws, the abolition or alteration of old
ones, and the like, are to be avoided if they are not
excused by imperative requirements of war; only the
latter permit legislation which exceeds the need of
a provisional administration. The French Republic,
at the end of the eighteenth century, frequently abolished
the preexisting constitution in the States conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
by it, and substituted a Republican one, but
this is none the less contrary to the law of nations
to-day. On the other hand, a restriction of the freedom
of the Press, of the right of association, and of
public meeting, the suspension of the right of election
to the Parliament and the like, are in some circumstances
a natural and unavoidable consequence of the
state of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_119">The Inhabitants
must
obey.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of the occupied territory owe the
same obedience to the organs of Government and administration
of the conqueror as they owed before
the occupation to their own. An act of disobedience
cannot be excused by reference to the laws or commands
of one’s own Government; even so an attempt
to remain associated with the old Government or to
act in agreement with it is punishable. On the other
hand, the provisional Government can demand nothing
which can be construed as an offense against one’s
own Fatherland or as a direct or indirect participation
in the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_120">Martial Law.</div>

<p>The civil and criminal jurisdiction continues in
force as before. The introduction of an extraordinary
administration of justice&mdash;martial law and
courts-martial&mdash;is therefore only to take place if
the behavior of the inhabitants makes it necessary.
The latter are, in this respect, to be cautioned, and
any such introduction is to be made known by appropriate
means. The courts-martial must base any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
sentence on the fundamental laws of justice, after
they have first impartially examined, however summarily,
the facts and have allowed the accused a free
defense.</p>

<p>The conqueror can, as administrator of the country
and its Government, depose or appoint officials.
He can put on their oath the civil servants, who continue
to act, as regards the scrupulous discharge of
their duties. But to compel officials to continue in
office against their will does not appear to be in the
interest of the army of occupation. Transgressions
by officials are punished by the laws of their country,
but an abuse of their position to the prejudice of the
army of occupation will be punished by martial law.</p>

<p>Also judicial officers can be deposed if they permit
themselves to oppose publicly the instructions of the
provisional Government. Thus it would not have
been possible, if the occupation of Lorraine in the
year 1870&ndash;71 had been protracted, to avoid deposing
the whole bench of Judges at Nancy and substituting
German Judges, since they could not agree
with the German demands in regard to the promulgation
of sentence.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_121">Fiscal Policy.</div>

<p>The financial administration of the occupied territory
passes into the hands of the conqueror. The
taxes are raised in the preexisting fashion. Any increase
in them due to the war is enforced in the form
of “War levies.” Out of the revenue of the taxes
the costs of the administration are to be defrayed, as,
generally speaking, the foundations of the State property
are to be kept undisturbed. Thus the domains,
forests, woodlands, public buildings and the like, although
utilized, leased, or let out, are not to be sold
or rendered valueless by predatory management. On
the other hand it is permitted to apply all surplus
from the revenues of administration to the use of the
conqueror.</p>

<p>The same thing holds good of railways, telegraphs,
telephones, canals, steamships, submarine cables and
similar things; the conqueror has the right of sequestration,
of use and of appropriation of any receipts,
as against which it is incumbent upon him to
keep them in good repair.</p>

<p>If these establishments belong to private persons,
then he has indeed the right to use them to the fullest
extent; on the other hand he has not the right to
sequestrate the receipts. As regards the right of annexing
the rolling-stock of the railways, the opinions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
of authoritative teachers of the law of nations differ
from one another. Whilst one section regard all
rolling-stock as one of the most important war resources
of the enemy’s State, and in consequence
claim for the conqueror the right of unlimited sequestration,
even if the railways belonged to private
persons or private companies,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> on the other hand the
other section incline to a milder interpretation of
the question, in that they start from the view that
the rolling-stock forms, along with the immovable
material of the railways, an inseparable whole, and
that one without the other is worthless and is therefore
subject to the same laws as to appropriation.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
The latter view in the year 1871 found practical recognition
in so far as the rolling-stock captured in
large quantities by the Germans on the French railways
was restored at the end of the war; a corresponding
regulation was also adopted by the Hague Conference
in 1899.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_122">Occupation
must be real
not fictitious.</div>

<p>These are the chief principles for the administration
of an occupied country or any portion of it.
From them emerges quite clearly on the one hand
the duties of the population, but also on the other
the limits of the power of the conqueror. But the
enforcement of all these laws presupposes the actual
occupation of the enemy’s territory and the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
of really carrying them out.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> So-called “fictitious
occupation,” such as frequently occurred in
the eighteenth century and only existed in a declaration
of the claimant, without the country concerned
being actually occupied, are no longer recognized by
influential authorities on the law of nations as valid.
If the conqueror is compelled by the vicissitudes of
war to quit an occupied territory, or if it is voluntarily
given up by him, then his military sovereignty
immediately ceases and the old State authority of
itself again steps into its rights and duties.</p>

<h2 id="h_187">PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">USAGES OF WAR AS REGARDS NEUTRAL STATES</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_123">What neutrality
means.</div>

<p>By the neutrality of a State is to be understood non-participation
in the war by third parties; the duly
attested intention not to participate in the conduct of
the war either in favor of, or to the prejudice of,
either one of the two belligerents. This relationship
gives rise in the case of the neutral State to certain
rights but also to fixed duties. These are not laid
down by international regulations or international
treaties; we have therefore here also to do with
“Usages of War.”</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_124">A neutral
cannot be all
things to all
men; therefore
he must
be nothing to
any of them.</div>

<p>What is principally required of a neutral State is
equal treatment of both belligerents. If, therefore,
the neutral State could support the belligerents at all,
it would have to give its support in equal measure to
both parties. As this is quite impossible and as one
of the two parties&mdash;and probably every one of them&mdash;would
regard itself as injured in any case, it
therefore follows as a practical and empirical principle
“not to support the two [<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, either or both]
belligerents is the fundamental condition of neutrality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_125">But there
are limits to
this detachment.</div>

<p>But this principle would scarcely be maintained in
its entirety, because in that case the trade and intercourse
of the neutral State would in some circumstances
be more injured than that of the belligerents
themselves. But no State can be compelled to act
against its own vital interests, therefore it is necessary
to limit the above principle as follows: “No
neutral State can support the belligerents as far as
military operations are concerned. This principle
sounds very simple and lucid, its content is, however,
when closely considered very ambiguous and in
consequence the danger of dissensions between neutral
and belligerent States is very obvious.”</p>

<p>In the following pages the chief duties of neutral
States are to be briefly developed. It is here assumed
that neutrality is not to be regarded as synonymous
with indifference and impartiality towards
the belligerents and the continuance of the war. As
regards the expression of partizanship all that is required
of neutral States is the observance of international
courtesies; so long as these are observed
there is no occasion for interference.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_126">Duties of the
neutral.</div>

<p>The chief duties of neutral States are to be regarded
as:</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_127">Belligerents
must be
warned off.</div>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. The territory of neutral States is available for none
of the belligerents for the conduct of its military
operations.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The Government of the neutral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
State has therefore, once War is declared, to
prevent the subjects of both parties from marching
through it; it has likewise to prevent the
laying out of factories and workshops for the
manufacture of War requisites for one or
other of the parties. Also the organization of
troops and the assembling of “Freelances” on
the territory of neutral States is not allowed by
the law of nations.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_128">The neutral
must guard
its inviolable
frontiers. It
must intern
the Trespassers.</div>

<p>2. If the frontiers of the neutral State march with
those of the territory where the War is being
waged, its Government must take care to occupy
its own frontiers in sufficient strength to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
any portions of the belligerent Armies stepping
across it with the object of marching
through or of recovering after a Battle, or of
withdrawing from War captivity. Every member
of the belligerent Army who trespasses upon
the territory of the neutral State is to be disarmed
and to be put out of action till the end of
the War. If whole detachments step across, they
must likewise be dealt with. They are, indeed,
not prisoners of War, but, nevertheless, are to be
prevented from returning to the seat of War. A
discharge before the end of the War would presuppose
a particular arrangement of all parties
concerned.</p>

<p class="nohang">If a convention to cross over is concluded,
then, according to the prevalent usages of War,
a copy of the conditions is to be sent to the Victor.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
If the troops passing through are taking
with them prisoners of War, then these are to
be treated in like fashion. Obviously, the neutral
State can later demand compensation for the
maintenance and care of the troops who have
crossed over, or it can keep back War material
as a provisional payment. Material which is
liable to be spoilt, or the keeping of which would
be disproportionately costly, as, for example, a
considerable number of horses, can be sold, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the net proceeds set off against the cost of internment.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_129">Unneutral

<div class="hideb"> </div>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_130">The “sinews
of war”&mdash;loans
to
belligerents.</div>

<p>3. A neutral State can support no belligerent by furnishing
military resources of any kind whatsoever,
and is bound to prevent as much as possible
the furnishing of such wholesale on the part
of its subjects. The ambiguity of the notion
“Kriegsmittel” has often led to complications.
The most indispensable means for the conduct
of a War is money. For this very reason it is
difficult to prevent altogether the support of one
or other party by citizens of neutral States, since
there will always be Bankers who, in the interest
of the State in whose success they put confidence,
and whose solvency in the case of a defeat they
do not doubt, will promote a loan. Against this
nothing can be said from the point of view of
the law of nations; rather the Government of a
country cannot be made responsible for the actions
of individual citizens, it could only accept
responsibility if business of this kind was done
by Banks immediately under the control of the
State or on public Stock Exchanges.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_131">Contraband
of War.</div>

<p class="nohang">It is otherwise with the supply of contraband
of war, that is to say, such things as are supplied
to a belligerent for the immediate support
of war as being warlike resources and equipment.
These may include:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Weapons of war (guns, rifles, sabers, etc.,
ammunition, powder and other explosives,
and military conveyances, etc.).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Any materials out of which this kind of
war supplies can be manufactured, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>saltpeter, sulphur, coal, leather, and the
like.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Horses and mules.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Clothing and equipment (such as uniforms
of all kinds, cooking utensils, leather
straps, and footwear).</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Machines, motor-cars, bicycles, telegraphic
apparatus, and the like.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_132">Good
business.</div>

<p class="nohang">All these things are indispensable for the conduct
of war, their supply in great quantities
means a proportionately direct support of the
belligerent. On the other hand, it cannot be
left out of account that many of the above-mentioned
objects also pertain to the peaceable needs
of men, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i.e.</i>, to the means without which the
practise of any industry would be impossible,
and the feeding of great masses of the population
doubtful. The majority of European
States are, even in time of peace, dependent on
the importation from other countries of horses,
machines, coal, and the like, even as they are
upon that of corn, preserved foods, store cattle,
and other necessaries of life. The supply of
such articles by subjects of a neutral State may,
therefore, be just as much an untainted business
transaction and pacific, as a support of a belligerent.
The question whether the case amounts to
the one or the other is therefore to be judged
each time upon its merits. In practise, the following
conceptions have developed themselves in
the course of time:</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_133">Foodstuffs.</div>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The purchase of necessaries of life, store
cattle, preserved foods, etc., in the territory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of a neutral, even if it is meant, as a
matter of common knowledge, for the revictualing
of the Army, is not counted a
violation of neutrality, provided only that
such purchases are equally open to both
parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_134">Contraband
on a small
scale.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The supply of contraband of war, in small
quantities, on the part of subjects of a
neutral State to one of the belligerents is,
so far as it bears the character of a peaceable
business transaction and not that of
an intentional aid to the war, not a violation
of neutrality. No Government can be
expected to prevent it in isolated and trivial
cases, since it would impose on the States
concerned quite disproportionate exertions,
and on their citizens countless sacrifices
of money and time. He who supplies
a belligerent with contraband does so on
his own account and at his own peril, and
exposes himself to the risk of Prize.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_135">And on a
large scale.</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The supply of war resources on a large
scale stands in a different position. Undoubtedly
this presents a case of actual
promotion of a belligerent’s cause, and generally
of a warlike succor. If, therefore,
a neutral State wishes to place its detachment
from the war beyond doubt, and to
exhibit it clearly, it must do its utmost to
prevent such supplies being delivered.
The instructions to the Customs authorities
must thus be clearly and precisely set
out, that on the one hand they notify the
will of the Government to set their face
against such wanton bargains with all their
might, but that on the other, they do not
arbitrarily restrict and cripple the total
home trade.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_136">The practise
differs.</div>

<p class="nohang">In accordance with this view many neutral
States, such as Switzerland, Belgium, Japan, etc.,
did, during the Franco-Prussian War, forbid all
supply or transit of arms to a belligerent, whilst
England and the United States put no kind of
obstacles whatsoever in the way of the traffic
in arms, and contented themselves with drawing
the attention of their commercial classes to the
fact that arms were contraband, and were therefore
exposed to capture on the part of the injured
belligerent.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p class="nohang">It is evident, therefore, that the views of this
particular relation of nations with each other
still need clearing up, and that the unanimity
which one would desire on this question does not
exist.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_137">Who may
pass&mdash;the
Sick and the
Wounded.</div>

<p>4. The neutral State may allow the passage or transport
of wounded or sick through its territory
without thereby violating its neutrality; it has,
however, to watch that hospital trains do not
carry with them either war personnel or war
material with the exception of that which is
necessary for the care of the sick.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote" id="sn_138">Who may
not pass&mdash;Prisoners
of
War.</div>

<p>5. The passage or transport of prisoners of war
through neutral territory is, on the other hand,
not to be allowed, since this would be an open
favoring of the belligerent who happened to be
in a position to make prisoners of war on a large
scale, while his own railways, water highways,
and other means of transport remained free for
exclusively military purposes.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the most important duties of neutral
States so far as land warfare is concerned. If they
are disregarded by the neutral State itself, then it
has to give satisfaction or compensation to the belligerent
who is prejudiced thereby. This case may
also occur if the Government of the neutral State,
with the best intentions to abstain from proceedings
which violate neutrality, has, through domestic or
foreign reasons, not the power to make its intentions
good. If, for example, one of the two belligerents
by main force marches through the territory of a
neutral State and this State is not in a position to
put an end to this violation of its neutrality, then
the other belligerent has the right to engage the
enemy on the hitherto neutral territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_139">Rights of
the neutral.</div>

<p>The duties of neutral States involve corresponding
rights, such as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_140">The neutral
has the right
to be left
alone.</div>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. The neutral State has the right to be regarded as
still at peace with the belligerents as with
others.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_141">Neutral
territory is
sacred.</div>

<p>2. The belligerent States have to respect the inviolability
of the neutral and the undisturbed exercise
of its sovereignty in its home affairs, to abstain
from any attack upon the same, even if the
necessity of war should make such an attack desirable.
Neutral States, therefore, possess also
the right of asylum for single members or adherents
of the belligerent Powers, so far as no
favor to one or other of them is thereby implied.
Even the reception of a smaller or larger detachment
of troops which is fleeing from pursuit does
not give the pursuer the right to continue his
pursuit across the frontier of the neutral territory.
It is the business of the neutral State
to prevent troops crossing over in order to reassemble
in the chosen asylum, reform, and sally
out to a new attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_142">The neutral
may resist a
violation of
its territory
“with all
the means
in its
power.”</div>

<p>3. If the territory of a neutral State is trespassed
upon by one of the belligerent parties for the
purpose of its military operations, then this
State has the right to proceed against this violation
of its territory with all the means in its
power and to disarm the trespassers. If the
trespass has been committed on the orders of the
Army Staff, then the State concerned is bound
to give satisfaction and compensation; if it has
been committed on their own responsibility, then
the individual offenders can be punished as
criminals. If the violation of the neutral territory
is due to ignorance of its frontiers and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
to evil intention, then the neutral State can demand
the immediate removal of the wrong, and
can insist on necessary measures being taken to
prevent a repetition of such contempts.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_143">Neutrality
is presumed.</div>

<p>4. Every neutral State can, so long as it itself keeps
faith, demand that the same respect shall be
paid to it as in time of peace. It is entitled
to the presumption that it will observe strict
neutrality and will not make use of any declarations
or other transactions as a cloak for an injustice
against one belligerent in favor of the
other, or will use them indifferently for both.
This is particularly important in regard to
Passes, Commissions, and credentials issued by
a neutral State.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<div class="sidenote" id="sn_144">The property
of neutrals.</div>

<p>5. The property of the neutral State, as also that of
its citizens, is, even if it lies within the seat of
war, to be respected so far as the necessity of war
allows. It can obviously be attacked and even
destroyed in certain circumstances by the belligerents,
but only if complete compensation be
afterwards made to the injured owners. Thus&mdash;to
make this clear by an example from the
year 1870&mdash;the capture and sinking of six English
colliers at Duclaix was both justified and
necessary on military grounds, but it was, for
all that, a violent violation of English property,
for which on the English side compensation was
demanded, and on the German side was readily
forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote" id="sn_145">Diplomatic

intercourse with the belligerent Powers
undisturbed, so far as military measures do
not raise obstacles in the way of it.</p></blockquote>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> I have based the remarks which follow on a close study of

works of statesmen who could legitimately say of their times
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quorum pars magna fui</i>. Lord Fitzmaurice’s book, apart from
its being the work of a statesman, whose knowledge of foreign
affairs is equaled by few and surpassed by none, is indispensable
to a study of Anglo-German relations since 1850,
being based on diplomatic sources, in particular the despatches
of Lord Odo Russell. Some passages in <cite>The Life of Lord Lytton</cite>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The study which follows is based on cosmopolitan materials:
The reader must exercise great caution in using political
memories such as those of Bismarck. In autobiography,
of all forms of history, as Goethe observes in the preface to
<cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wahrheit und Dichtung</cite>, it is supremely difficult for the writer
to escape self-deception; he is so apt to read himself backwards
and to mistake society’s influence upon him for his influence
upon society. In the case of Bismarck in particular,
his autobiography often took the form of apologetics, and he
invests his actions with a foresight which they did not always
possess, while, on the other hand, he is so anxious to depreciate
his rivals (particularly Gortchakoff) that he often robs
himself of the prestige of victory. Hohenlohe is, in this respect,
a far safer guide. He was not as great a man as Bismarck,
but he was an infinitely more honest one.</p></div>

on the subject of the Franctireurs in the war of

whether the marks worn by the Franctireurs were sufficient
or not. This was denied on the German side in many
cases with all the greater justification as the usual dress of
the Franctireurs, the national blue, was not to be distinguished
from the customary national dress, as it was merely
a blouse furnished with a red armlet. Besides which, on the
approach of German troops, the armlet was often taken off
and the weapons were concealed, thereby offending against the
principle of open bearing. These kind of offenses, as also the

and barbarous troops on a European seat of war, that is
simply because the war of 1870 lies nearest to us in point of
time and of space. On a level with it is the employment of
Russo-Asiatic nationalities in the wars of emancipation, of
Indians in the North-American War, of the Circassians in the
Polish Rising, of the Bashi-bazouks in the Russo-Turkish War,
etc. As regards the Turcos, a Belgian writer Rolin-Jacquémyns
said of them in regard to the war of 1859, “les allures
et le conduite des Turcos avaient soulevé d’universels dégoûts.”
On the other side it is not to be forgotten that a section of the
French Press in 1870 praised them precisely because of their
bestialities and incited them to such things, thus in the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Independance

answered in a document of September 27th, 1870, as follows:
“The authorization of exchange of correspondence in the case
of a fortress is not generally one of the usages of war; and
although we would authorize willingly the forwarding of open
letters from diplomatic agents, in so far as their contents be

on the German side towards the French fortresses. At the
beginning of the siege of Strassburg it was announced to the
French Commander that free passage was granted to the
women, the children, and the sick, a favor which General
Uhrich rejected, and the offer of which he very wisely did
not make known to the population. And when later three
delegates of the Swiss Federal Council sought permission in
accordance with the resolution of the Conference at Olten, of
September 7th, to carry food to the civil population in Strassburg
and to conduct non-combatants out of the town over the
frontier, both requests were willingly granted by the besieger
and four thousand inhabitants left the fortress as a result of
this permission. Lastly, the besiegers of Belfort granted to
the women, children, aged, and sick, free passage to Switzerland,
not indeed immediately at the moment chosen by the
commander Denfert, but indeed soon after” (<cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Dahn</cite>, I, p. 89).
Two days after the bombardment of Bitsch had begun (September
11th) the townsfolk begged for free passage out of
the town. This was, indeed, officially refused; but, none the
less, by the indulgence of the besieger, it was effected by a
great number of townspeople. Something like one-half of the
2,700 souls of the civil population, including the richest and

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Considering the many unintelligible things written on the
French side about this, the opinion of an objective critic is
doubly valuable. Monod, p. 55, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">op. cit.</i>, says: “I have seen
Bazeilles burning; I have informed myself with the greatest
care as to how things happened. I have questioned French
soldiers, Bavarian soldiers, and Bavarian inhabitants present
at this terrible drama; I am able to see in it only one of the
frightful, but inevitable, consequences of the war.” As to the
treatment of Chateaudun, stigmatized generally on the French
side as barbarous, the author writes (p. 56): “The inhabitants
of Chateaudun, regularly organized as part of the National
Guard, aided by the franctireurs of Paris, do not defend
themselves by preparing ambushes but by fighting as soldiers.
Chateaudun is bombarded; nothing could be more legitimate,
since the inhabitants made a fortress of it; but once they got
the upper hand the Bavarians set fire to more than one hundred
houses.” The picture of outrages by Germans which follows
may be countered by what the author writes in another
place about the French soldiers: “The frightful scenes at
the taking of Paris by our troops at the end of May, 1871,
may enable us to understand what violences soldiers allow
themselves to be drawn into, when both excited and exhausted
by the conflict.”</p></div>

be a doubtful practise, and thinks that this kind of deception
should not extend beyond the preparations for battle. “In
battle the opponents should engage one another openly, and
should not fall on an enemy from behind in the mask of a
friend and brother in arms.” The Manual of the Institute of
International Law goes further. It says in 8 (<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>):
“Il est interdit d’attaquer l’ennemi en dissimulant les signes

Sedan: (1) The French army surrender as prisoners of

Officers, and Officials occupying the rank of Officers, will receive
their freedom so soon as they give their word of honor
in writing not to take up arms again until the end of the
war, and not to behave in a manner prejudicial to the interests
of Germany. The officers and officials who accept these
conditions are to keep their arms and their own personal
effects. (3) All arms and all war material consisting of
flags, eagles, cannons, munitions, etc., are to be surrendered
and to be handed over by a French military commission to
German commissioners. (4) The fortress of Sedan is to be
immediately placed at the disposition (of the Germans) exactly
as it stands. (5) The officers who have refused the obligation
not to take up arms again, as well as the troops, shall
be disarmed and organized according to their regiments or
corps to go over in military fashion. The medical staff are
without exception to remain behind to look after the wounded.
</p>
<p>
Metz: The capitulation of Metz allowed the disarmed soldiers
to keep their knapsacks, effects, and camp equipment,
and allowed the officers who preferred to go into captivity,
rather than give their word of honor, to take with them their
swords, or sabers, and their personal property.

<p>
Belfort: The garrison were to receive all the honors of war,
to keep their arms, their transport, and their war material.
Only the fortress material was to be surrendered.
</p>
<p>
Bitsch (concluded after the settlement of peace): (1) The
garrison retires with all the honors of war, arms, banners, artillery,
and field pieces. (2) As to siege material and munitions
of war a double inventory is to be prepared. (3) In the
same way an inventory is to be taken of administrative material.
(4) The material referred to in Articles 2 and 3 is to
be handed over to the Commandant of the German forces. (5)
The archives of the fortress, with the exception of the Commandant’s
own register, are left behind. (6) The customs
officers are to be disarmed and discharged to their own homes.
(7) The canteen-keepers who wish to depart in the ordinary
way receive from the local commandant a pass viséd by the German
local authorities. (8) The local Commandant remains
after the departure of the troops at the disposal of the German
higher authorities till the final settlement; he binds himself
on his word of honor not to leave the fortress. (9) The
troops are transported with their horses and baggage by the
railroad. (10) The baggage left behind in Bitsch by the officers
of the 1st and 5th Corps will be sent later to an appointed
place in France, two non-commissioned officers remain to guard
it and later to send it back under their supervision.

During the fight which took place at Chaffois on January
29th, 1871, when the village was stormed, the cry of Armistice
was raised on the French side. A French officer of the General
Staff communicated to the Commander of the 14th Division
by the presentation of a written declaration the news of an
armistice concluded at Versailles for the whole of France.
The document presented, which was directed by the Commander-in-Chief
of the French Army in the East, General Clinchant,
to the Commander of the French Division engaged at Chaffois,
ran as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“An armistice of twenty-one days has been signed on the
27th. I have this evening received the official news. Cease
fire in consequence and inform the enemy, according to the
forms followed in war, that the armistice exists and that you
are charged to bring it to his knowledge.
</p>

<p class="sigright">(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="smcap">Clinchant</span>.”</p>
<p class="p0 in2">Pontarlier, January, 29th, 1871.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Of the conclusion of this armistice no one on the German
side had any knowledge. None the less hostilities ceased for
the time being, pending the decision of the higher authorities.
Since on the enemy’s side it was asserted that a portion of
the French troops in Chaffois had been made prisoners after
the news of the existence of the armistice was communicated,
and the order to cease fire had been given, some thousand
French prisoners were set free again in recognition of this
possibility, and the arms which had been originally kept back
from them were later restored to them again. When the proceedings
at Chaffois were reported, General von Manteuffel decided
on the 30th January as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The news of an armistice for the Army of the South is
false; the operations are to be continued, and the gentlemen
in command are on no other condition to negotiate with the
enemy than that of laying down their arms. All other negotiations
are, without any cessation of hostilities, to be referred
to the Commander-in-Chief.”</p></blockquote>

<p>
“Soldiers! the pursuit of the enemy who has been thrust
back after bloody struggles has already led a great part of our
army across the frontier. Several corps will to-day and to-morrow
set foot upon French soil. I expect that the discipline
by which you have hitherto distinguished yourselves will be
particularly observed on the enemy’s territory. We wage no
war against the peaceable inhabitants of the country; it is
rather the duty of every honor-loving soldier to protect private
property and not to allow the good name of our army
to be soiled by a single example of bad discipline. I count
upon the good spirit which animates the army, but at the same
time also upon the sternness and circumspection of all leaders.

in a position to gratify my soldiers thereby; I would have
done it if I had found it advantageous. But nothing is more

the Battle of Pultawa, stayed for years in Bender, sold the
conquered principalities of Bremen and Verden to the King
of England, Elector of Hanover, before England had yet
declared war on Sweden. This undoubtedly unlawful act of
England first received formal recognition in the Peace of Stockholm,
1720.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The German administration desired that, as hitherto, justice
should be administered in the name of the Emperor (Napoleon
III). The Court, on the contrary, desired, after the
revolution of September 4th, 1870, to use the formula: “In
the name of the French Republic.” The Court no longer recognized
the Emperor as Sovereign, the German authorities did
not yet recognize the Republic. Finally the Court, unfortunately
for the inhabitants, ceased its activities. The proper
solution would have been, according to Bluntschli (547), either
the use of a neutral formula, as, for example, “In the name of
the law,” or the complete omission of the superfluous formula.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The passage of French troops through Prussian territory in
October, 1805, was a contempt of Prussian neutrality.&mdash;The
moment the Swiss Government permitted the Allies to march
through its territory in the year 1814, it thereby renounced
the rights of a neutral State.&mdash;In the Franco-Prussian War
the Prussian Government complained of the behavior of Luxemburg
in not stopping a passage <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">en masse</i> of fugitive French
soldiers after the fall of Metz through the territory of the
Grand Duchy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> The considerable reenforcement of the Servian Army in the
year 1876 by Russian Freelances was an open violation of
neutrality, the more so as the Government gave the officers
permission, as the Emperor himself confessed later to the English
Ambassador in Livadia. The English Foreign Enlistment
Act of 1870, Art. 4,<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> forbids all English subjects during a war
in which England remains neutral, to enter the army or the
navy of a belligerent State, or the enlistment for the purpose,
without the express permission of the Government. Similarly
the American law of 1818. The United States complained
energetically during the Crimean War of English recruiting
on their territory.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> [This Act applies to British subjects wherever they may

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> At the end of August, 1870, some French detachments, without
its being known, marched through Belgian territory;
others in large numbers fled after the Battle at Sedan to
Belgium, and were there disarmed. In February, 1871, the
hard-pressed French Army of the East crossed into Switzerland
and were there likewise disarmed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> In the negotiations in 1793, as to the neutrality of North
America in the Anglo-French War, Jefferson declared: “The
right of the citizens to fashion, sell, and export arms cannot
be suspended by a foreign war, but American citizens pursue
it on their own account and at their own risk.”&mdash;Bluntschli,
sec. 425 (2). Similarly in the famous treaty between Prussia
and the United States of September 10th, 1785, it was expressly
fixed in Article 13 that if one of the two States was involved
in war and the other State should remain neutral, the traders
of the latter should not be prevented from selling arms and
munitions to the enemy of the other. Thus the contraband
articles were not to be confiscated, but the merchants were to
be paid the value of their goods by the belligerent who had
seized them. This arrangement was, however, not inserted
in the newer treaties between Prussia and the Union in 1799
and 1828.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> In the exchange of despatches between England and Germany
which arose out of the English deliveries of arms, the
English Minister, Lord Granville, declares, in reply to the complaints
of the German Ambassador in London, Count Bernstorff,
that this behavior is authorized by the preexisting practise,
but adds that “with the progress of civilization the obligations
of neutrals have become more stringent, and declares
his readiness to consult with other nations as to the possibility
of introducing in concert more stringent rules, although his
expectations of a practical result are, having regard to the
declarations of the North-American Government, not very hopeful.”
President Grant had, it is true, already in the Neutrality
Proclamation of August 22nd, 1870, declared the trade in
contraband in the United States to be permitted, but had
uttered a warning that the export of the same over sea was
forbidden by international law. He had later expressly forbidden
the American arsenal administration to sell arms to a
belligerent, an ordinance which was of course self-evident and
was observed even in England, but he did not attempt to
prevent dealers taking advantage of the public sale of arms
out of the State arsenals to buy them for export to the French.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Belgium allowed itself, in August, 1870, owing to the opposition
of France, to be talked into forbidding the transport of
wounded after the Battle of Sedan, through Belgian territory,
and out of excessive caution interpreted its decree of August
27th as amounting to a prohibition of the transport even of
individual wounded. The French protest was based on the
contention that by the transport of wounded through Belgium,
the military communication of the enemy with Germany was
relieved from a serious hindrance. “On such a ground”&mdash;thinks
Bluntschli (p. 434)&mdash;“one might set one’s face against
the transport of large numbers but not the transport of individuals.
These considerations of humanity should decide.”</p></div>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
